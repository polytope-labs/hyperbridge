# Running a node

The Hyperbridge node can be obtained through a variety of ways. For now, only release artifacts for x86 linux environments are officially distributed. You can also build the node from source if you prefer.

## System Requirements

Since Hyperbridge is a parachain which internally runs a Polkadot node, it also has the same hardware requirements as the [Polkadot validator node](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/maintain-guides-how-to-validate-polkadot#requirements).

## Docker

Hyperbridge is available at the official docker repository [`polytopelabs/hyperbridge`](https://hub.docker.com/r/polytopelabs/hyperbridge)

```bash
docker pull polytopelabs/hyperbridge:latest
```

## Prebuilt Binaries

You can install a prebuilt binary for the hyperbridge node with the following bash script

```bash
LATEST_TAG=$(curl -s https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/polytopelabs/hyperbridge/tags\?page_size\=1\&page\=2 | jq -r '.results[0].name')
wget -q --show-progress https://github.com/polytope-labs/hyperbridge/releases/download/hyperbridge-$LATEST_TAG/hyperbridge-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
tar -xvzf hyperbridge-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
# copy to $PATH
cp hyperbridge-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/hyperbridge $HOME/.local/bin/
```

or a 1-liner shell script

```bash
LATEST_TAG=$(curl -s https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/polytopelabs/hyperbridge/tags\?page_size\=1\&page\=2 | jq -r '.results[0].name')
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/polytope-labs/hyperbridge/releases/download/hyperbridge-$LATEST_TAG/hyperbridge-installer.sh | sh
```

## Building from source

You can follow the steps below if you'd prefer to build the hyperbridge node from source:

::::steps

### Install dependencies

Building the hyperbridge node requires some dependencies

- git
- clang
- curl
- make
- build-essential
- libssl-dev
- llvm
- libudev-dev
- protobuf-compiler

:::code-group

```bash [Debian]
sudo apt update
sudo apt install --assume-yes git clang curl libssl-dev llvm libudev-dev make protobuf-compiler
```

```bash [Arch]
pacman -Syu --needed --noconfirm curl git clang make protobuf
```

```bash [Fedora]
sudo dnf update
sudo dnf install clang curl git openssl-devel make protobuf-compiler
```

```bash [Opensuse]
sudo zypper install clang curl git openssl-devel llvm-devel libudev-devel make protobuf
```

:::

### Install rust compiler

If you don't have an already existing rust installation, you can install it using the one-liner below. Follow the prompts displayed to proceed with a default installation.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Install webassembly target

Hyperbridge's blockchain runtime compiles to wasm which allows its code to be forklessly upgraded. In order to build hyperbridge we need the wasm toolchain installed.

```bash
rustup update nightly
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
rustup component add rust-src
```

### Clone the repo

Download a local copy of the repo and checkout the latest release tag

```bash
# fetch the latest tag from docker hub
LATEST_TAG=$(curl -s https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/polytopelabs/hyperbridge/tags\?page_size\=1\&page\=2 | jq -r '.results[0].name')
git clone https://github.com/polytope-labs/hyperbridge.git
cd ./hyperbridge
git checkout ${LATEST_TAG}
```

### Build the node

```bash
cargo build --release -p hyperbridge
```

The hyperbridge node will now be available at `target/release/hyperbridge`, You can move the binary to your `$PATH` so you can run it directly.

Update your path to include `${HOME}/.local/bin`. If you are using Bash, run the following.
Alternatively, replace `${HOME}/.bashrc` with `${HOME}/.zshrc` if using Zsh.
Replace `source` with `.` if necessary.

```bash
export RC_PATH=${HOME}/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="${HOME}/.local/bin:${PATH}"' >> ${RC_PATH}
source ${RC_PATH}
```

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.local/bin/
mv target/release/hyperbridge $HOME/.local/bin/
```

## Running the node

Hyperbridge exists as a parachain on various networks including testnet and mainnet. You can run a node on the following networks:

### Paseo

Hyperbridge is available on the Paseo testnet, with a chainId of `gargantua` and paraId of `4009`. You can sync the paseo relay chain in a few minutes by appending a relay chain argument `--sync=fast-unsafe`. This tells the relay chain node to simply download its blocks and not execute them. It'll also download the full latest state. This is fine because the paseo testnet has no economic value.

```bash
export PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS=<your-node-public-ip-address>
hyperbridge \
    --base-path=$HOME/.hyperbridge \
    --pruning=archive \
    --name="Your node name here"  \
    --rpc-cors=all \
    --rpc-port=9944 \
    --unsafe-rpc-external \
    --rpc-methods=unsafe \
    --chain=gargantua \
    --no-mdns \
    --listen-addr=/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/30333 \
    --listen-addr=/ip6/::/tcp/30333 \
    --public-addr=/ip4/$PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS/tcp/30333 \
    --out-peers=32 \
    -- \
    --sync=fast-unsafe
```

### Polkadot

Hyperbridge is also live on Polkadot with a chainId of `nexus` and ParaId of `3367`.

```bash
export PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS=<your-node-public-ip-address>
hyperbridge \
    --base-path=$HOME/.hyperbridge \
    --pruning=archive \
    --name="Your node name here"  \
    --rpc-cors=all \
    --rpc-port=9944 \
    --unsafe-rpc-external \
    --rpc-methods=unsafe \
    --chain=nexus \
    --no-mdns \
    --listen-addr=/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/30333 \
    --listen-addr=/ip6/::/tcp/30333 \
    --public-addr=/ip4/$PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS/tcp/30333 \
    --out-peers=32
```

### Ansible Playbooks

A community member has graciously provided their ansible playbook for running the hyperbridge node. You can find it here:

 - [schmiatz/hyperbridge-node](https://github.com/schmiatz/hyperbridge-node)

### Miscellaneous

Ensure that your firewall and NAT configuration allow incoming connections on port `30333` for optimal peering with other nodes on the network.

```bash
sudo ufw allow 30333
```
