# Hyperbridge

Hyperbridge is a fully chain-agnostic interoperability protocol that enables developers to build applications that can securely interoperate with any blockchain. For the first time, developers can build mission-critical cross-chain applications secured by interoperability proofs.

## Getting Started

If you're new to Hyperbridge and its workings, we suggest starting with the [Hyperbridge Protocol Specification](/protocol). After gaining a basic understanding, you can delve into the [explore section](/developers/explore/) to discover the protocol's main components. Once familiar, you can begin creating your own applications using the Hyperbridge SDK, which we offer for various onchain execution environments.


## Solidity SDK

We provide a Solidity SDK that allows your solidity smart contracts not only send and receive cross-chain messages through Hyperbridge, but make cross-chain storage queries. This SDK is designed to be easy to use and provides a simple interface for interacting with the Hyperbridge protocol. Jump into the [tutorials section](/developers/tutorials/) to get started.

## Polkadot SDK

We provide the ISMP SDK that allows substrate-based chains to send and receive cross-chain messages through Hyperbridge. This SDK augments the existing substrate runtime with the ability to send and receive cross-chain messages, make cross-chain storage queries, and more. Jump into the [tutorials section](/developers/tutorials/) to get started.

## Network Operators

Network operators are responsible for running the Hyperbridge network. They are responsible for relaying messages and producing blocks. Network operators are incentivized to run the network by receiving fees from users who wish to perform cross-chain operations.
