# Timeouts

Blockchains may become incapable of processing transactions for a vareity of reasons. These might include _liveness failures_, which can occur when the state transition function becomes unable to produce new blocks, consensus faults, transaction fee spikes that make transaction execution unprofitable, or a doomsday scenario such as a nation state sanctioned attack.

Regardless of the reason, if the destination becomes incapable of processing incoming ISMP requests, the framework provides a timeout mechanism. This feature allows for the safe reversion of state changes on the source chain that were executed prior to dispatching the request, as if no issue ever occurred.

`PostRequest`, `PostResponse`, and `GetRequest` all have the ability to time out due to their `timeout_timestamp` value. This value stipulates the lifespan of a message. A `PostRequest` and `PostResponse` will time out when their destination's `host.timestamp()` surpasses the `timeout_timestamp`. This asserts that the destination has indeed not processed the relevant messages. Conversely, a `GetRequest` times out when its source's `host.timestamp()` surpasses the sending chain's `timeout_timestamp`.

## Handlers

The ISMP framework exposes a handler that allows users/relayers submit timeouts, alongside the neccessary state proofs required for verification so that they may be executed by `IsmpModules`s

### `handle_timeouts`

```rust showLineNumbers
/// A timeout message holds a batch of messages to be timed-out
pub enum TimeoutMessage {
    /// A non membership proof for POST requests
    Post {
        /// Timed out requests
        requests: Vec<Post>,
        /// Non membership batch proof for these requests
        timeout_proof: Proof,
    },
    /// A non membership proof for POST responses
    PostResponse {
        /// Timed out responses
        responses: Vec<PostResponse>,
        /// Non membership batch proof for these responses
        timeout_proof: Proof,
    },
    /// There are no proofs for Get timeouts, we only need to
    /// ensure that the timeout timestamp has elapsed on the host
    Get {
        /// Requests that have timed out
        requests: Vec<GetRequest>,
    },
}

/// Handle timed out messages
pub fn handle_timeouts<H>(host: &H, msg: TimeoutMessage) -> Result<(), Error>
where
    H: IsmpHost,
{
    // .. implementation details
}
```

The `handle_timeouts` is used to notify onchain `IsmpModule`s of outgoing requests or responses that have now timed out. A relayer will construct the `TimeoutMessage` which holds a batch of these messages, and their relevant proofs. The handler will perform the following operations

- Assert that the state machine's consensus client is not frozen
- Assert that the configured `challenge_period` for the `StateCommitment` has elapsed
- Assert that the messages have indeed timed out
- Assert that the claimed messages are known by the host
- Assert that the relevant state machine's time has advanced past the `timeout_timestamp` of specified messages.
- Assert that the relevant non-membership proofs for the messages are valid
- Finally dispatch the timeouts to the relevant `IsmpModule::on_timeout` and delete the commitments for the outgoing messages.

:::danger
It's important to note that if the `IsmpModule::on_timeout` does not return `Ok`, the commitment of the relevant messages will not be deleted, allowing the timeout to be **replayed**. Consequently, the `IsmpModule` is responsible for maintaining all invariants before modifying it's internal state to prevent partial state changes that could result in critical vulnerabilities in their timeout handler. This model ensures that if a timeout cannot be executed successfully, it can be retried later.
