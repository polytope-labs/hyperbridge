# Pallet ISMP

This is the implementation of ISMP for substrate chains. It is the foundational component that allows communication over ISMP. It correctly composes the various ISMP components in the runtime.

## Runtime Integration

Including `pallet-ismp` in a substrate runtime requires implementing the pallet config.

```rust showLineNumbers [runtime.rs]
parameter_types! {
    // For example, the hyperbridge parachain on Polkadot
    pub const Coprocessor: Option<StateMachine> = Some(StateMachine::Polkadot(3367));
    // The host state machine of this pallet, your state machine id goes here
    pub const HostStateMachine: StateMachine = StateMachine::Polkadot(1000); // polkadot
    // pub const HostStateMachine: StateMachine = StateMachine::Kusama(1000); // kusama
    // pub const HostStateMachine: StateMachine = StateMachine::Substrate(*b"MYID"); // solochain
}

impl pallet_ismp::Config for Runtime {
    // Configure the runtime event
    type RuntimeEvent = RuntimeEvent;
    // Permissioned origin who can create or update consensus clients
    type AdminOrigin = EnsureRoot<AccountId>;
    // The state machine identifier for this state machine
    type HostStateMachine = HostStateMachine;
    // The pallet_timestamp pallet
    type TimestampProvider = Timestamp;
    // The currency implementation that is offered to relayers
	// this could also be `frame_support::traits::tokens::fungible::ItemOf`
    type Currency = Balances;
    // The balance type for the currency implementation
    type Balance = Balance;
    // Router implementation for routing requests/responses to their respective modules
    type Router = Router;
    // Optional coprocessor for incoming requests/responses
    type Coprocessor = Coprocessor;
    // Supported consensus clients
    type ConsensusClients = (
        // as an example, the parachain consensus client
        ismp_parachain::ParachainConsensusClient<Runtime, IsmpParachain>,
    );
    // Offchain database implementation. Outgoing requests and responses are
    // inserted in this database, while their commitments are stored onchain.
    //
    // The default implementation for `()` should suffice
    type OffchainDB = ();
    // The fee handler implementation
    type FeeHandler = WeightFeeHandler<()>;
}

construct_runtime! {
    // ...
    Ismp: pallet_ismp
}
```

### Config

Let's go through some of the ISMP specific components of the configuration.

* `HostStateMachine`:
This is the state machine identifier for your chain, it will be used as the **source value for all requests that are dispatched from this chain** For parachains, this should be your parachain id e.g `StateMachine::Polkadot(1000)`.

* `Coprocessor`:
ISMP is built around the idea of a coprocessor that aggregates consensus and state proofs from multiple state machines into a more succinct proof that is cheaply verifiable.
This component defines the state machine identifier of the supported coprocessor, Hyperbridge is a coprocessor for ISMP.

* `ConsensusClients`:
This is a tuple of types that implement the `ConsensusClient` interface, it defines all the consensus algorithms supported by this deployment of the protocol.

* `OffchainDB`:
 This implementation provides the interface for persisting requests and responses to the offchain db. Only commitments of requests and responses are stored onchain

* `Router`:
The router is a type that provides an `IsmpModule` implementation for a module id.

### Router

The `IsmpRouter` is a module which produces an `IsmpModule` implementation for a given module identifier.

```rust showLineNumbers [runtime.rs]
#[derive(Default)]
struct Router;

impl IsmpRouter for Router {
    fn module_for_id(&self, id: Vec<u8>) -> Result<Box<dyn IsmpModule>, Error> {
        let module = match id.as_slice() {
           YOUR_MODULE_ID => Box::new(YourModule::default()),
           // ... other modules
            _ => Err(Error::ModuleNotFound(id))?
        };
        Ok(module)
    }
}

/// Some custom module capable of processing some incoming/request or response.
/// This could also be a pallet itself.
#[derive(Default)]
struct YourModule;

impl IsmpModule for YourModule {
    /// Called by the ISMP hanlder, to notify module of a new POST request
    /// the module may choose to respond immediately, or in a later block
    fn on_accept(&self, request: Post) -> Result<(), Error> {
        // do something useful with the request
        Ok(())
    }

    /// Called by the ISMP hanlder, to notify module of a response to a previously
    /// sent out request
    fn on_response(&self, response: Response) -> Result<(), Error> {
         // do something useful with the response
         Ok(())
    }

     /// Called by the ISMP hanlder, to notify module of requests that were previously
     /// sent but have now timed-out
 	fn on_timeout(&self, request: Timeout) -> Result<(), Error> {
        // revert any state changes that were made prior to dispatching the request
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

### FeeHandler

The `FeeHandler` is responsible for calculating and settling fees for ISMP message processing. It enables flexible fee models that can be tailored to your chain's economic requirements.

#### Purpose and Capabilities

The `FeeHandler` configuration allows you to:

- Calculate fees based on the computational resources (weight) used to process messages
- Implement different fee structures for various message types (requests, responses, consensus)
- Create custom incentive structures for relayers and validators
- Support subsidized operations or negative fee models
- Adapt fees based on network conditions or message priority

#### Default Implementation

The simplest implementation is the `WeightFeeHandler`, which calculates fees based on message processing weight:

```rust showLineNumbers [runtime.rs]
// For a simple weight-based fee model:
type FeeHandler = WeightFeeHandler<ModuleWeightProvider>;
```

#### Custom Weight Provider

To provide accurate weight measurements for each module's callbacks, implement the `WeightProvider` trait:

```rust showLineNumbers [runtime.rs]
struct YourModuleBenchmarks;

impl pallet_ismp::weights::IsmpModuleWeight for YourModuleBenchmarks {
    /// Should return the benchmark weight for processing this request
    fn on_accept(&self, request: &Post) -> Weight {
        // Return actual benchmarked weight for the operation
        Weight::from_parts(150_000_000, 0)
    }

    /// Should return the benchmark weight for processing this timeout
    fn on_timeout(&self, request: &Timeout) -> Weight {
        Weight::from_parts(100_000_000, 0)
    }

    /// Should return the benchmark weight for processing this response
    fn on_response(&self, response: &Response) -> Weight {
        Weight::from_parts(120_000_000, 0)
    }
}

struct ModuleWeightProvider;

impl pallet_ismp::weights::WeightProvider for ModuleWeightProvider {
    fn module_callback(dest_module: ModuleId) -> Option<Box<dyn IsmpModuleWeight>> {
        match dest_module.to_bytes().as_slice() {
            YOUR_MODULE_ID => {
                Some(Box::new(YourModuleBenchmarks))
            }
            // ... other modules
            _ => None
        }
    }
}
```

Alternatively, you can use the default weight provider if you don't need custom weights.


```rust showLineNumbers [runtime.rs]
// Default weight provider returns `Weight::zero()`
type FeeHandler = WeightFeeHandler<()>;
```


#### Custom Fee Handlers

For more advanced fee models, you can implement your own `FeeHandler`:

```rust showLineNumbers [runtime.rs]
struct CustomFeeHandler;

impl pallet_ismp::fee_handler::FeeHandler for CustomFeeHandler {
    fn on_executed(messages: Vec<Message>) -> DispatchResultWithPostInfo {
        // Implement custom fee logic based on message types
        // For example, different fee strategies for different message types:
        let weight = calculate_consumed_weight(&messages);

        // Determine if the operation pays fees based on your economic model
        let pays_fee = if contains_only_consensus_messages(&messages) {
            // incentivize consensus messages here using a custom fee strategy
            Pays::No
        } else {
            // Regular messages pay normal fees
            Pays::Yes
        };

        Ok(PostDispatchInfo {
            actual_weight: Some(weight),
            pays_fee,
        })
    }
}
```

#### Fee Considerations

When designing your fee model, consider:

1. **Economic sustainability** - Ensure relayers are properly incentivized
2. **Spam prevention** - Set fees high enough to prevent DoS attacks
3. **User experience** - Keep fees reasonable for legitimate users
4. **Computational efficiency** - Fee calculations should be lightweight
5. **Special message types** - Consider if certain critical messages (like consensus updates) should have different fee structures


## Interfaces

The `pallet_ismp::Pallet<T>` implements the neccessary interfaces for the ISMP framework. These are:

 - [`IsmpHost`](/protocol/ismp/host): Pallet ISMP implements `IsmpHost` interface providing all the storage and cryptographic requirements for the ISMP handlers. Modules that need to interact with the low-level ISMP framework can use this interface to access the necessary storage items they wish to read.

 :::danger[IMPORTANT]
 It is **not recommended** for 3rd-party modules to alter the storage items directly, unless you absolutely know what you are doing.
 :::

 - [`IsmpDispatcher`](/protocol/ismp/dispatcher): It implements `IsmpDispatcher` allowing it to dispatch requests and responses. This is the low-level ISMP framework dispatcher. It can be used to dispatch requests that are not addressed to Hyperbridge and perhaps meant for other state machines. Dispatching requests to be Hyperbridge should be done throught the [`pallet-hyperbridge`](/developers/polkadot/fees#pallet-hyperbridge) module. Which also implements the `IsmpDispatcher` interface but collects the necessary fees.


## Calls

* ### `create_consensus_client`
This is a priviledged call used to initialize the consensus state of a consensus client. Consensus clients must to be initialized with a trusted state, so this call must only be called by a trusted party.
<br />


* ### `update_consensus_state`
This is a priviledged call used to update the unbonding period or challenge_period for a consensus client. It must only be called by a trusted parties to prevent consensus exploits.
<br />

* ### `handle_unsigned`
Execute the provided batch of ISMP messages, this will short-circuit and revert if any of the provided messages are invalid. This is an unsigned extrinsic that permits anyone
execute ISMP messages for free, provided they have valid proofs and the messages havenot been previously processed.
The dispatch origin for this call must be an unsigned one.
Emits different message events based on the Message received if successful.
Only available when the pallet is built with the `unsigned` feature flag.
<br />

* ### `handle`
Execute the provided batch of ISMP messages. This call will short-circuit and revert if any of the provided messages are invalid.
The dispatch origin for this call must be a signed one.
Emits different message events based on the Message received if successful.
Only available when the `unsigned` feature flag is disabled.
<br />

* ### `fund_message`
During periods of high transaction fees on the destination chain, you can increase the relayer fee for in-flight requests and responses to incentivize their delivery.
Simply call this function with the request/response commitment and the desired fee increase amount.
Should not be called on a message that has been completed (delivered or timed-out) as those funds will be lost forever.

## Transaction fees

Pallet ISMP offers a two different approaches to transaction fees.

### Unsigned

This essentially means all cross-chain messages received are executed for free as unsigned transactions. The upside to this is that it cannot be exploited as a spam vector, since the transaction pool will check if the submitted extrinsics are valid before they are included in the pool. This validity check ensures that the transaction can be successfully executed and contains valid proofs. Malformed messages or those with invalid proofs are filtered out by the transaction pool validation logic preventing unnecessary processing and potential network congestion.

### Signed

In this method, relayers and users will need to pay the native token for executing cross-chain messages. This is likely more preferrable but requires that the token be widely available.


## Miscellaneous

### Offchain Indexing

The `pallet-ismp` only stores "commitments" (hashes) of requests onchain for storage proofs, while the full requests are stored offchain and using the [offchain indexing api](https://docs.rs/sp-io/38.0.0/sp_io/offchain/index.html). It would be prudent to enable offchain indexing by default in the node, so all nodes on the network store all requests offchain. You can do this in your `run` function in `command.rs`. [Here's an example](https://github.com/polytope-labs/hyperbridge/blob/main/parachain/node/src/command.rs#L168-L170)

```rust showLineNumbers [command.rs]
/// Parse command line arguments into service configuration.
pub fn run() -> Result<()> {
	let mut cli = Cli::from_args();

	// all full nodes should store request/responses, otherwise they'd basically be useless without
	// it.
	cli.run.base.offchain_worker_params.indexing_enabled = true; // [!code hl]
	// .. other stuff
}
```

### Signed Extensions

The teseract messaging relayer expects the following signed extensions to be present in the runtime in the same order listed below

```rust showLineNumbers [runtime.rs]
/// The SignedExtension to the basic transaction logic.
pub type SignedExtra = (
	frame_system::CheckNonZeroSender<Runtime>,
	frame_system::CheckSpecVersion<Runtime>,
	frame_system::CheckTxVersion<Runtime>,
	frame_system::CheckGenesis<Runtime>,
	frame_system::CheckEra<Runtime>,
	frame_system::CheckNonce<Runtime>,
	frame_system::CheckWeight<Runtime>,
	pallet_transaction_payment::ChargeTransactionPayment<Runtime>,
	frame_metadata_hash_extension::CheckMetadataHash<Runtime>,
);
```
