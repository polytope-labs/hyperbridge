# Proxies

We already know that ISMP mimics the HTTP API, in terms of requests and responses, using POST requests to send data and GET requests for cross-chain state reads. It also allows for request and response proxies, akin to a typical [HTTP proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server). An ISMP proxy simply redirects incoming requests and responses to an external state machine.

In this context, **the proxy functions as a coprocessor**. Without it, the state machine would have to independently verify its consensus and state proofs of an incoming request. This verification could be prohibitively expensive. For instance, if a single state machine had to verify consensus proofs for all state machines it receives requests from, it would significantly increase the cost of interoperability. This highlights the value of a proxy state machine, intentionally designed to be inexpensive to verify. It proxies requests by carrying out the costly verification computations on its chain, and providing cheaper proofs for its consumer chains.

A blockchain may configure any of its connected state machines on the `IsmpHost` as a proxy. This allows the state machine to direct requests & responses from its connected chains to the chain. If a state machine is not configured as a proxy, then any requests from this chain must have their `source` matching the state machine identifier. This protocol invariant must be maintained for the security of modules that use the request metadata for message authentication.

A word of caution on ISMP proxies. Since a proxy can serve requests from any chain, it is now elevated a trusted actor. There's a possibility for the proxy to fabricate requests that seem to come from a specific state machine but actually originate from its chain with malicious intent, such as stealing funds or causing damage. To mitigate this, proxies must be fully decentralized with no admin keys or privileged actors who have superuser-like write permissions to its state. Otherwise, they could write a malicious request directly to the ISMP module state, bypassing all protocol checks.

## Hyperbridge as a Proxy

Hyperbridge serves as an instance of an ISMP proxy, aggregating the consensus proofs and messages from all its connected chains. This allows any chain to receive all of its intended messages directly from Hyperbridge through a single consensus proof. Hyperbridge is fully decentralized and governed by its own token, without any privileged actors with superuser permissions. This level of decentralization is only achievable as a Polkadot parachain with decentralized on-chain governance, permissionless block producers, and forkless upgrades that facilitate the support for new chains.
