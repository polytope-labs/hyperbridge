# Message delivery

The design of ISMP as a proof based protocol allows for permissionless delivery of messages. This means that any party with valid proofs can deliver ismp messages.

## Submitting Ismp messages

Messages can be delivered through the `handle` extrinsic. This extrinsic is permissionless and can be called by any party that can pay the required transaction fees and has the required state proofs.
When using Hyperbridge as a coprocessor, the proofs for messages are Merkle patricia trie proofs generated from pallet-ismp's child trie on Hyperbridge.
Messages can be delivered in batches, for a message batch to execute successfully, every individual message in the batch must verify correctly, any invalid message will cause the batch to fail.

## Post Request Messages

## Post Response Messages

## Get Requests

## Get Response Messages

## Timeout Messages

A timeout message can be submitted for any message that was not delivered before timeout timestamp elapsed on the destination chain. This timeout message requires a proof of non-membership from hyperbridge if it's a Post request or Post response.
Get request timeouts require no state proofs
