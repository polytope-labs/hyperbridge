# Timeouts

Blockchains may become incapable of processing transactions for to various reasons. These might include _liveness failures_, which can occur when the state transition function becomes unable to produce new blocks, consensus faults, transaction fee spikes that make transaction execution unprofitable, or a doomsday scenario such as a nation state sanctioned attack.

Regardless of the reason, if the destination chain cannot process incoming ISMP requests, the framework provides a timeout mechanism. This feature allows for the safe reversion of state changes on the source chain that were executed prior to dispatching the request, as if no issue ever occurred.

POST requests, POST responses, and GET requests have the ability to time out due to their `timeout_timestamp` value. This value defines the lifespan of a message. A `PostRequest` and `PostResponse` will time out when their destination's `host.timestamp()` surpasses the `timeout_timestamp`. Conversely, a `GetRequest` times out when its source's `host.timestamp()` surpasses the `timeout_timestamp`.
