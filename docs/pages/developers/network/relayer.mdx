# Running a Relayer

The Hyperbridge relayer (tesseract) can be obtained through a variety of ways. For now only release artifacts for x86 linux environments are officially distributed. You can also build the relayer from source if you prefer.

## Prebuilt binaries

You can install a prebuilt binary for the Tesseract relayer with the following bash script

```bash
LATEST_TAG=$(curl -s https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/polytopelabs/tesseract/tags\?page_size\=1\&page\=2 | jq -r '.results[0].name')
wget -q --show-progress https://github.com/polytope-labs/hyperbridge/releases/download/tesseract-$LATEST_TAG/tesseract-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
tar -xvzf tesseract-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
# copy to $PATH
cp tesseract-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/tesseract $HOME/.local/bin/
```

or a 1-liner

```bash
LATEST_TAG=$(curl -s https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/polytopelabs/tesseract/tags\?page_size\=1\&page\=2 | jq -r '.results[0].name')
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/polytope-labs/hyperbridge/releases/download/tesseract-$LATEST_TAG/tesseract-installer.sh | sh
```

## Docker

Tesseract is available at the official docker repository [`polytopelabs/tesseract`](https://hub.docker.com/r/polytopelabs/tesseract)

```bash
docker pull polytopelabs/tesseract:latest
```

## Building from source

You can follow the steps below if you'd prefer to build the tesseract relayer from source:

::::steps

### Install dependencies

Building the Tesseract relayer requires some dependencies

- git
- clang
- curl
- make
- build-essential
- libssl-dev
- llvm
- libudev-dev
- protobuf-compiler

:::code-group

```bash [Debian]
sudo apt update
sudo apt install --assume-yes git clang curl libssl-dev llvm libudev-dev make protobuf-compiler
```

```bash [Arch]
pacman -Syu --needed --noconfirm curl git clang make protobuf
```

```bash [Fedora]
sudo dnf update
sudo dnf install clang curl git openssl-devel make protobuf-compiler
```

```bash [Opensuse]
sudo zypper install clang curl git openssl-devel llvm-devel libudev-devel make protobuf
```

:::

### Install the rust compiler

If you don't have an already existing rust installation, you can install it using the one-liner below. Follow the prompts displayed to proceed with a default installation.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Clone the repo

Download a local copy of the repo and checkout the latest release version.

```bash
# fetch the latest tag from docker hub
LATEST_TAG=$(curl -s https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/polytopelabs/tesseract/tags\?page_size\=1\&page\=2 | jq -r '.results[0].name')
git clone https://github.com/polytope-labs/hyperbridge.git
cd ./hyperbridge
git checkout tesseract-${LATEST_TAG}
```

### Build the tesseract relayer

```bash
cargo build --release -p tesseract
```

The Tesseract relayer will now be available at `target/release/tesseract`, You can move the binary to your `$PATH` so you can run it directly.

<br />
Update your path to include `${HOME}/.local/bin`. If you are using Bash, run the
following. Alternatively, replace `${HOME}/.bashrc` with `${HOME}/.zshrc` if
using Zsh. Replace `source` with `.` if necessary.

```bash
# add .local/bin to path if it doesn't exist
export RC_PATH=${HOME}/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="${HOME}/.local/bin:${PATH}"' >> ${RC_PATH}
source ${RC_PATH}

# create dir if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p $HOME/.local/bin/
mv target/release/tesseract $HOME/.local/bin/
```

::::

## Running the relayer

The tesseract relayer command line interface expects two arguments, which are the paths to its configuration file and database file. If you're running it in a docker container, you will need to [map the directory](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/#start-a-container-with-a-bind-mount) where you've stored the configuration files on your host into the docker container. Tesseract will write its database to that directory once it's initialized.

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name=tesseract \
  --network=host \
  --restart=always \
  --volume=/dir/on/host:/home/root \
  polytopelabs/tesseract:latest \
  --config=/home/root/config.toml \
  --db=/home/root/tesseract.db
```

Access its logs using

```bash
docker logs -f tesseract
```

### System Requirements

At the minimum, the hyperbridge relayer should be run on a machine with at least 4GB of RAM and a quad-core cpu. This relayer should also have at least a 100Mb/s connection if it is to query nodes over the internet.

### Ansible Playbooks

A community member has graciously provided their ansible playbook for running the hyperbridge relayer. You can find it here:

- [schmiatz/hyperbridge-relayer](https://github.com/schmiatz/hyperbridge-relayer)

## Configuration

The configuration file is a toml file that at the moment, that expects the following configuration options:

state_machine = "EVM-11155111"
# http(s) rpc urls for evm based chains
# Multiple rpc endpoints supported for increased reliability
rpc_urls = ["http://127.0.0.1:8545", ""]
# The consensus state identifier for this chain on hyperbridge.
# For Ethereum and its L2s this will be "ETH0", for BSC this will be "BSC0".
consensus_state_id = "ETH0"
# Etherscan api key for querying the state machine's native token price.
# Do not that ethereum and all its L2's use ETH as the native token
# So they can all share the same key gotten from etherscan.

# hex-encoded private key for the relayer account on this chain
signer = ""
# (Optional)
# Maximum number of concurrent rpc requests that can be used when tracing. If not supplied
# will trace entire transaction batches at once. This increases tracing speeds by performing
# tracing operations concurrently
#
# Note: Your rpc provider must support handling a large number of requests/sec(> 200 requests / sec) in parallel.
# Note: if you use the same provider for all your endpoints then a very high request/sec threshold is required (> 1000 / sec)
tracing_batch_size = 5 # 5 transactions would be traced concurrently on this client
# (Optional)
# Buffer to add to gas price as a percentage of the current gas price
# to increase likelihood of the transactions going through e.g 1%, 2%
gas_price_buffer = 1
# (Optional)
# The execution client implementation only Geth or Erigon are fully supported
# The possible values:

# must be one of:
# - "POLKADOT-{paraId}"
# - "KUSAMA-{paraId}"
state_machine = "KUSAMA-4009"

consensus_state_id = "PARA"
# hex-encoded private key for the relayer account on this chain
signer = ""
# (Optional) Frequency with which to query the chain for new state machine updates,
poll_interval = 10
# (Optional) initial height
# This sets the height at which to start querying messages,
# This exists for testing and development, wrong use can cause the rpc to be overloaded with queries
# initial_height = 1000
```

It is optional to provide the configuration option for any of the connected chains, The only consequence is your relayer will not deliver requests from the ommitted chain as it has no way of querying the associated fees for requests originating from this chain.

You can obtain the required etherscan API key by following [this guide](https://docs.etherscan.io/getting-started/viewing-api-usage-statistics) for the appropriate network. Do note that since Ethereum and its L2s all use Ether as the gas token. They can all share the same etherscan API key.

### Contract addresses

You can find the addresses for the `IsmpHost` contracts for [mainnet](developers/evm/contracts/mainnet) and [testnet](developers/evm/contracts/testnet)

## Withdrawing Fees

Tesseract maintains a local sqlite database where it keeps track of successfully delivered messages. The withdrawal process happens in two phases, the first phase is the fee accumulation on hyperbridge, then withdrawal on any of the connected chains.
In the fee accumulation phase, tesseract submits state proofs of messages all delivered to hyperbridge. If the proof verification is successful, the total amount of unclaimed fees for the relayer address is updated onchain. Next, the relayer can submit a withdrawal transaction to hyperbridge. This initiates potentially multiple ISMP requests to any chain where it has unclaimed fees, that instructs the Hyperbridge contract to credit the relayer their owed funds. This request will not timeout, allowing it to be submitted to the destination chain at any time.

### Accumulating fees

Stop any running relayer instances, run the following command in the terminal and wait for it to complete. The command will submit proofs for messages delivered to all chains present in the config file.

```bash
tesseract --config=$HOME/config.toml --db=$HOME/tesseract.db accumulate-fees
```

When accumulating fees the required state machine update to verify the proofs might not yet be available on hyperbridge, by default accumulating fees for those state machines will be skipped. To wait for all state machine updates.

```bash
tesseract --config=$HOME/config.toml --db=$HOME/tesseract.db accumulate-fees --wait
```

### Initiating withdrawals

To initiate a withdrawal from hyperbridge, a relayer needs to submit a transaction to hyperbridge with triggers the withdrawal request. This extrinsic is unsigned and will not require any native tokens for execution fees.Once the extrinsic is executed, hyperbridge dispatches a POST request that when executed on its destination, will provide the relayer with the fees they've accrued. The relayer account must have sufficient funds to deliver this request to its destination chain.

<br />
To use this feature run the following command:

```bash
tesseract --config=$HOME/config.toml --db=$HOME/tesseract.db accumulate-fees --withdraw
```

### Automatic accumulation and withdrawals

The relayer also runs background tasks for automatic fee accumulation and withdrawals. Whenever a batch of messages is successfully delivered, the fee accumulation task receives the delivery receipts and starts the process of accumulating the fees on hyperbridge. This process happens concurrently for all successfully delivered message batches. For redundancy, the delivery receipts are stored in the database prior to accumulation so they can be retried manually if any error is encountered.

<br />
Withdrawing fees from hyperbridge is triggered at fixed intervals based on the
configured `withdrawal_frequency` and `minimum_withdrawal_amount`. Feel free to
the adjust these values as desired. The task will only make a withdrawal attempt
if your balance on hyperbridge is greater than or equal to the configured
`minimum_withdrawal_amount`. Any failed withdrawal attempts will be retried each
time the withdrawal task is triggered. The manual processes described in the
previous sections can be used as fallbacks when errors are encountered by their
automated conterparts.
