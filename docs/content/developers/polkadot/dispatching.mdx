# Dispatching Requests & Responses

This section explores the means by which pallets may leverage Hyperbridge to dispatch cross-chain messages. It's important to understand that in Hyperbridge protocol, there are 3 different kinds of cross-chain messages. We'll explore each of them Below.

## POST Requests

A POST request is simply a cross-chain message to be executed by some `IIsmpModule` on a destination. A POST request may also timeout, potentially as a result of liveness failures of the destination chain or failure to execute the message successfully. Through this mechanism, modules can "catch" this failure similar to the try/catch pattern and handle the failure case in the `on_timeout` callback.


```rust showLineNumbers
pub struct DispatchPost {
    pub dest: StateMachine,
    pub from: Vec<u8>,
    pub to: Vec<u8>,
    pub timeout: u64,
    pub body: Vec<u8>,
}

struct FeeMetadata<T> {
    pub payer: <T as Config>::AccountId,
    pub fee: <T as Config>::Balance,
}

pub enum DispatchRequest {
    Post(DispatchPost),
    Get(DispatchGet),
}

trait IsmpDispatcher  {
    fn dispatch_request(
        &self,
        request: DispatchRequest,
        fee: FeeMetadata<T>,
    ) -> Result<H256, Error>;

    // ...
}
```

### Dispatch Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `dest` | Destination chain, for this you'll use the `StateMachine` enum eg `StateMachine::Evm(1)` for Ethereum Mainnet. |
| `from` | The initiaing module identifier on the source chain. |
| `to` | Receiving module/contract address on the destination chain. |
| `body` | Serialized byte representation of the message (to be decoded by the receiving contract). |
| `timeout` | Time in seconds for message validity eg 3600 for a timeout of 1 hour, or 0 for no timeout. ie Messages will never expire. If the timeout is set to a non-zero value, messages that have exceeded this timeout will be rejected on the destination and require user action (timeout message) to revert changes. |
| `fee` | Optional relayer fees, should only be used if `pallet-hyperbridge` is the `IsmpDispatcher`. This can be set to zero if the application developers or users prefer to self-relay. If not this will withdraw the provided fee from the `Currency` implementation configured on `pallet-ismp`. |
| `payer` | The account that should receive a refund of the relayer fees if the request times out. |

```rust showLineNumbers
#[pallet::weight(T::dispatch())]
#[pallet::call_index(0)]
pub fn send_message(
    origin: OriginFor<T>,
    post: DispatchPost,
    fee: T::Balance,
) -> DispatchResultWithPostInfo {
    let signer = ensure_signed(origin)?;
    let dispatcher = pallet_ismp::Pallet::<Runtime>::default();
    let commitment = dispatcher.dispatch_request(
        DispatchRequest::Post(post),
        FeeMetadata {
            payer: signer,
            fee,
        }
    )?;

    Ok(())
}
```

## POST Responses

Dispatching a POST response, going by it's name is, well, a response to a previously received POST request. Dispatching a POST response requires that the module has indeed received a post request from a counterparty chain in a previous transaction.

```rust showLineNumbers
pub struct PostResponse {
    pub post: PostRequest,
    pub response: Vec<u8>,
    pub timeout_timestamp: u64,
}

trait IsmpDispatcher {
    fn dispatch_response(
        &self,
        request: PostResponse,
        fee: FeeMetadata<T>,
    ) -> Result<H256, Error>;

    // ...
}
```
### Dispatch Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `post` | The previously received request object. The full object is required to authenticate if the response is eligible for dispatch. |
| `response` | Serialized byte representation of the response message (to be decoded by the receiving contract). |
| `timeout_timestamp` | Time in seconds for message validity eg 3600 for a timeout of 1 hour, or 0 for no timeout. ie Messages will never expire. If the timeout is set to a non-zero value, messages that have exceeded this timeout will be rejected on the destination and require user action (timeout message) to revert changes. |
| `fee` | Optional relayer fees, should only be used if `pallet-hyperbridge` is the `IsmpDispatcher`. This can be set to zero if the application developers or users prefer to self-relay. If not this will withdraw the provided fee from the `Currency` implementation configured on `pallet-ismp`. |
| `payer` | The account that should receive a refund of the relayer fees if the request times out. |

```rust showLineNumbers
#[pallet::weight(T::dispatch())]
#[pallet::call_index(0)]
pub fn send_response(
    origin: OriginFor<T>,
    request: PostRequest,
    fee: T::Balance,
) -> DispatchResultWithPostInfo {
    let signer = ensure_signed(origin)?;
    let dispatcher = pallet_ismp::Pallet::<Runtime>::default();
    let commitment = dispatcher.dispatch_response(
        PostResponse {
            post: request, 
            response: *b"Hello there".to_vec(),
            timeout_timestamp: 0, // no timeout
        },
        FeeMetadata {
            payer: signer,
            fee,
        }
    )?;

    Ok(())
}
```

## GET Requests

GET requests allow modules to perform asynchronous reads of a counterparty blockchain's state. This can be used to read either the [`Account`](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/tree/master/packages/util#module-account) object, which is stored in the world state, or even storage slots in a contract storage. Eg reading the price of a Uniswap pair on a remote chain.

When dispatching get requests, you specify the storage keys you need to read and the block height at which you need to read these storage entries.

```rust showLineNumbers
pub struct DispatchGet {
    pub dest: StateMachine,
    pub from: Vec<u8>,
    pub keys: Vec<Vec<u8>>,
    pub height: u64,
    pub context: Vec<u8>,
    pub timeout: u64,
}

struct FeeMetadata<T> {
    pub payer: <T as Config>::AccountId,
    pub fee: <T as Config>::Balance,
}

pub enum DispatchRequest {
    Post(DispatchPost),
    Get(DispatchGet),
}

trait IsmpDispatcher  {
    fn dispatch_request(
        &self,
        request: DispatchRequest,
        fee: FeeMetadata<T>,
    ) -> Result<H256, Error>;
    // ...
}
```

### Dispatch Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `dest` | The chain whose database should be read (e.g., `StateMachine::Evm(1)` for Ethereum Mainnet). |
| `from` | The initiaing module identifier on the source chain. |
| `height` | Block height at which the provided keys should be fetched. |
| `keys` | Storage keys whose values should be fetched and verified. See the Storage Keys section below for detailed guidance on deriving keys for different chain types. |
| `context` | Application-specific metadata relating to this request. This can be used to pass additional context that will be available in the response callback. |
| `timeout` | Time in seconds for message validity eg 3600 for a timeout of 1 hour, or 0 for no timeout. ie Messages will never expire. If the timeout is set to a non-zero value, messages that have exceeded this timeout will be rejected on the destination and require user action (timeout message) to revert changes. |
| `fee` | Hyperbridge protocol fees for processing the request. This should only be used if `pallet-hyperbridge` is the `IsmpDispatcher`. If non-zero this will withdraw the provided fee from the `Currency` implementation configured on `pallet-ismp`. |
| `payer` | The account initiating this request. |

### Storage Keys

The `keys` parameter is a vector of raw storage keys that will be used to fetch values from the counterparty chain. The method for deriving these keys depends on the type of chain you're querying:

#### Substrate Storage Keys

For Substrate-based chains, the algorithm for calculating raw storage keys varies by pallet storage type:

**StorageValue**
- Algorithm: `twox128(pallet_name) ++ twox128(storage_name)`
- [Reference](https://docs.rs/frame-support/latest/frame_support/storage/types/struct.StorageValue.html)

**StorageMap**
- Algorithm: `twox128(pallet_name) ++ twox128(storage_name) ++ hasher(encode(key))`
- [Reference](https://docs.rs/frame-support/latest/frame_support/storage/types/struct.StorageMap.html)

**StorageDoubleMap**
- Algorithm: `twox128(pallet_name) ++ twox128(storage_name) ++ hasher1(encode(key1)) ++ hasher2(encode(key2))`
- [Reference](https://docs.rs/frame-support/latest/frame_support/storage/types/struct.StorageDoubleMap.html)

**StorageNMap**
- Algorithm: `twox128(pallet_name) ++ twox128(storage_name) ++ hasher1(encode(key1)) ++ hasher2(encode(key2)) ++ ...`
- [Reference](https://docs.rs/frame-support/latest/frame_support/storage/types/struct.StorageNMap.html)

#### ink! Contract Storage Keys

For ink! smart contracts on Substrate chains, storage keys must be derived according to the ink! storage layout. Follow the guide at:
- [ink! Storage in Metadata - Full Example](https://use.ink/datastructures/storage-in-metadata#a-full-example)

#### EVM Storage Keys

For EVM chains, storage keys must be either **20 bytes** or **52 bytes**:

**52-byte keys**: Concatenation of contract address (20 bytes) + storage slot hash (32 bytes)
- Use this to read specific storage slots in a contract
- Example: Reading a mapping value or specific contract state variable

**20-byte keys**: Contract address or account address
- Use this to read the entire account state
- Returns the [Account object](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/tree/master/packages/util#module-account) from the world state

```rust showLineNumbers
#[pallet::weight(T::dispatch())]
#[pallet::call_index(0)]
pub fn read_state(
    origin: OriginFor<T>,
    get: DispatchGet,
    fee: T::Balance,
) -> DispatchResultWithPostInfo {
    let signer = ensure_signed(origin)?;
    let dispatcher = pallet_ismp::Pallet::<Runtime>::default();
    let commitment = dispatcher.dispatch_request(
        DispatchRequest::Get(get),
        FeeMetadata {
            payer: signer,
            fee,
        }
    )?;

    Ok(())
}
```

In the next section we'll look at how Hyperbridge collects it's fees.
