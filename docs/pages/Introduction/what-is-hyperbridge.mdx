# What is Hyperbridge?

Hyperbridge is the frontliner of consensus based bridges, using consensus proofs, state transition validity and consensus fault proofs to ensure secure and the integrity of transactions across chains. It is an interoperability coprocessor capable of scaling cryptographically secure, consensus & state proof-based interoperability to all blockchains.

## The challenge of interoperability.

Ensuring secure cross-chain communication involves verifying consensus, consensus faults, state proofs, and state transitions. However, conducting these verification processes on-chain is often prohibitively costly. Consequently, attestation networks have emerged, employing multi-sig committees to verify the state of counterpart chains. Unfortunately, these architectures have led to a collective loss of $2 billion in crypto assets (sources [1](), [2]()). We advocate for the adoption of cross-chain bridges with heightened security assumptions to pave the way for the next generation of secure cross-chain applications. This necessitates the development of a new kind of interoperability coprocessor that can scale consensus proofs, state proofs, and state transitions across multiple blockchains.

## How does it work?
 A single state machine can quickly become bottlenecked if it is to verify consensus proofs, state proofs & (re-execute) state transitions of it’s multiple connected state machines. This necessitates that the coprocessor must be multi-core and capable of verifying multiple state machines in parallel.

### The architecture
Hyperbridge does the consensus and state proof verifications of all it's connected networks on-chain, because it has access to more compute. This allows developers to aggregate the cross-chain messages from multiple connected blockchains, which are verified on multiple parachain cores, into a single zk consensus & state proof that can be verified cheaply on any chain.

### The Coprocessor model
We can view a consensus proof as evidence of completed work. By doing so, we can affirm that state machines embedded within protocols execute computations that are confirmable through consensus proofs. With this perspective, instead of depending exclusively on a zero-knowledge Zk-coprocessor, we can utilize another blockchain as a supplementary coprocessor.

This coprocessor must also be highly scalable and must not bottleneck message passing across it’s connected chains. You can see how a single state machine can quickly become bottlenecked if it is to verify consensus proofs, state proofs & (re-execute) state transitions of it’s multiple connected state machines. This necessitates that the coprocessor must be **multi-core**.

Ultimately, this blockchain coprocessor should boast the most cost-effective consensus and state proofs. Considering its primary function is to validate costly consensus proofs, it's counterproductive if the coprocessor itself incurs high expenses for this task. Economical consensus proofs can be realized through the utilization of BLS signatures and the APK proofs scheme, as suggested by researchers at the web3 foundation. By integrating these two approaches, only two pairing checks are necessary for consensus proof validation. Similarly, state proof verification should also be highly economical. Verkle tries utilizing KZG commitments remain the most economical known state trie scheme, allowing for the amortization of verification costs across multiple items in a state proof through a constant-sized proof and a single pairing check.

### Crypto-economic security
There must be a stake for each consensus proof. If this coprocessor were to initiate its own validator set via POS consensus, it could face susceptibility to governance attacks in its early stages. This vulnerability arises from the relatively low value of the network token stake, leading to diminished crypto-economic security. Consequently, Byzantine actors could swiftly seize control of the network, enabling them to validate blocks lacking valid work. Such a scenario would compromise applications relying on this coprocessor. To ensure secure interoperability through a blockchain coprocessor, the underlying blockchain must offer robust crypto-economic security assurances. Essentially, a substantial capital investment is necessary to deter Byzantine attacks.

By leveraging Polkadot as a consensus layer, we obtain high crypto-economic security, equivalent to almost $3 billion at the time of writing. This ensures that hyperbridge is resistant to governance attacks that would’ve otherwise successfully compromised the protocol if it had to bootstrap its own validator set. Hyperbridge is proudly secured by Polkadot.

### Consensus proofs
Additionally, we benefit cheap consensus proofs through BEEFY, which attests to the validity of all parachain state transitions secured by the network. Because of this, we can shard the work of validating consensus, state proof and state transition re-execution across multiple so-called parachain cores. This allows us to aggregate the cross-chain messages from multiple connected blockchains which are verified on multiple parachain cores into a single zk consensus & state proof that can be verified cheaply on any chain. 

This cost will be cheap enough to compete with non-consensus proof based bridges which simply verify MPC signatures onchain for attestation. It is critical to note that the reason this kind of interoperability coprocessor hasn’t been attempted before is because it is an architecture that is uniquely enabled by Polkadot. 

### ISMP
Hyperbridge is built on top of our in-house cross-chain messaging framework (Interoperable State Machine Protocol) ISMP. It has been designed to be modular and extensible, enabling us to quickly incorporate support for additional consensus systems and state machines with minimal new code. It provides a familiar HTTP-like API for developers who want to make cross-chain requests to trigger certain logic on the counterparty chain. Allowing devs to make POST requests to send arbitrary data to connected chains, as well as GET requests to read the storage (verified through state proofs) of applications on connected chains.

Additionally, it facilitates cross-chain message passing among connected chains, ISMP also serves as a synchronisation primitive across Hyperbridge's internal state machines. This enables its parachain cores to communicate with each other and delegate tasks. Making Hyperbridge to become the first multi-core parachain on Polkadot.

### Full node level security guarantees
With the ability to re-execute blocks of its connected chains, Hyperbridge achieves the elusive full node security in cross-chain bridges. This is accomplished by compressing the state witness, transaction data, and contract code, which can then be uncompressed and re-executed within a parachain core. This is how smart-contract parachains currently function on the Polkadot relay chain.


## Features 
Hyperbridge presents many features that make it a unique and powerful tool for developers. Here are some of the key features and tools that Hyperbridge offers:

### General Message passing 
Hyperbridge allows for general message passing among connected chains. This allows developers to send arbitrary data to connected chains, as well as read the storage of applications on connected chains. This is done through the ISMP API, which provides a familiar HTTP-like interface for developers to interact with.

### Gateway
Gateway is the dApp component of Hyperbridge. It allows developers bridge tokens across chains, and also provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the bridge. Gateway is built on top of the ISMP API, and provides a simple and intuitive way for users to bridge tokens across chains. You can play around with the Gateway dApp on the Hyperbridge testnet (here)[https://gateway.hyperbridge.network/].
