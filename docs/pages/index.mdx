# Hyperbridge Protocol

**Secure interoperability** requires the verification of various proofs, including consensus proofs, consensus fault proofs, state proofs, and state transition validity proofs. For blockchains to securely interoperate, they must **verify these proofs onchain** to confirm the finalized (irreversible) state of their counterparty.

However, these verification processes are compute-intensive and do not scale well, particularly when multiple blockchains need to communicate. This limitation leads to the proliferation of _attestation networks_ which employ the use of multi-sig committees who attest to the state of a counterparty chain. These types of architectures have resulted in a cumulative loss of $2 billion in crypto assets. (sources [[1]](https://defillama.com/hacks), [[2]](https://rekt.news/leaderboard/)).

The only true solution to this problem is the coprocessor model, where the verification operations are performed offchain and the results are securely reported back onchain alongside cryptographic proofs of correct execution.

## Coprocessor Model

Hyperbridge is an example of such a coprocessor, more specifically, a [crypto-economic coprocessor](https://blog.polytope.technology/cryptoeconomic-coprocessors). Hyperbridge pioneers a new class of coprocessors that leverage their [consensus proofs](https://research.polytope.technology/consensus-proofs) to attest to the correctness of the **computations performed onchain**.

## Proof Aggregation

Hyperbridge achieves trust-free interoperability by verifying and aggregating the finalized states of **all chains** on its own chain. It then uses a single proof to any chain to prove the finality of all the aggregated states. This architecture is what enables Hyperbridge to scale trust-free interoperability to all blockchains.

## Permissionless Relayers

Hyperbridge, the first cross-chain protocol of its kind, leverages cryptographic proofs to power a decentralized and permissionless network of relayers. These relayers, which operate **without the need for any whitelisting or staking**, are tasked with transmitting messages across chains on behalf of users and applications. They are incentivized to relay messages by the fees paid by users who wish to perform cross-chain operations.
