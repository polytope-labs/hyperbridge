# Overview

Hyperbridge brings together advanced cryptographic and mechanistic protocols to facilitate secure cross-chain interoperability.

The protocol is facilitated by:

 - A permissionless set of relayers that transmit cross-chain messages authenticated by cryptographic proofs.
 - Hyperbridge Nexus, a blockchain that serves as a crypto-economic coprocessor for aggregating interoperability proofs.
