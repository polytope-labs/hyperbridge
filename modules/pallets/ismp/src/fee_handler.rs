/// Trait for handling fee calculations and settlements in the ISMP protocol.
///
/// This trait defines the interface for fee handling strategies in cross-chain message processing.
/// Implementations can define various fee models based on the specific requirements of their
/// blockchain ecosystem, economic incentives, and governance preferences.
///
/// The ISMP protocol supports multiple types of messages, including requests, responses,
/// timeouts, and consensus messages, each potentially requiring different fee structures.
/// This trait allows for creating custom fee handling logic that can be tailored to specific
/// use cases.
///
/// ## Fee Handling Strategies
///
/// Implementations of this trait can support various fee models including:
///
/// * **Weight-based fees**: Charging based on computational resources used
/// * **Message-type-based fees**: Different fees for different message types
/// * **Subsidized models**: Where certain operations have reduced or zero fees
/// * **Incentive structures**: Where relayers or validators receive rewards
/// * **Market-based mechanisms**: Where fees adjust based on network congestion
///
/// ## Implementation Notes
///
/// Fee handlers should be designed with the following considerations:
///
/// 1. **Efficiency**: Fee calculation should be computationally inexpensive
/// 2. **Fairness**: Fees should fairly reflect resource usage
/// 3. **Economic security**: Fee models should prevent spam and DoS attacks
/// 4. **Incentive alignment**: Fee structures should encourage proper protocol participation
pub trait FeeHandler {
	/// Process a batch of successfully executed messages and calculate appropriate fees.
	///
	/// This method is invoked once a batch of messages have been successfully processed.
	/// It is the responsibility of implementers to calculate and return the appropriate
	/// `PostDispatchInfo` for fee calculation and settlement based on the messages processed.
	///
	/// ## Parameters
	///
	/// * `messages` - A vector of ISMP protocol messages that have been processed. This includes
	///   various message types such as requests, responses, timeouts, and consensus messages.
	///
	/// ## Returns
	///
	/// Returns a `DispatchResultWithPostInfo` which includes:
	///
	/// * `actual_weight` - The computational weight consumed by processing the messages
	/// * `pays_fee` - Whether the operation should incur fees or not
	///
	/// ## Design Flexibility
	///
	/// This method is deliberately designed to provide flexibility and support a wide range of fee
	/// collection strategies across different blockchain ecosystems. It can accommodate various
	/// economic models including:
	///
	/// * Traditional fee payments where users pay for message processing
	/// * "Negative fees" or incentive structures where relayers receive rewards
	/// * Hybrid models with different fee structures for different message types
	/// * Context-aware pricing based on network conditions or message priority
	///
	/// ## Implementation Considerations
	///
	/// Implementers should consider:
	///
	/// * The computational cost of processing different message types
	/// * Economic incentives for relayers and validators
	/// * Prevention of spam and denial-of-service attacks
	/// * Fairness across different types of network participants

/// A weight-based fee handler implementation that calculates fees based on message processing
/// weight.
///
/// This implementation computes the actual weight consumed by a batch of messages using the
/// provided `WeightProvider`.
///
/// ## Type Parameters
///
/// * `AccountId` - The account identifier type used to identify fee payers.
/// * `Provider` - A type implementing the `WeightProvider` trait that can calculate weights for
///   different module callbacks based on message types.
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// This handler is typically configured in a runtime to establish a weight-based fee model:
///
/// ```ignore
/// type FeeHandler = WeightFeeHandler<AccountId, WeightInfo>;
/// ```
