# Bridges

The web3 ecosystem is made up of a diverse array of blockchain networks, each with its own unique features, capabilities, and use cases. While this diversity is a key strength of the web3 ecosystem, it also presents challenges in terms of interoperability and communication between different networks. That is why we need bridges.

## What are bridges?

Bridges are fundamentally crucial to the suceess of web3, they give users the power to exchange information and transact freely. They remove the need to go through a centralized exchange to swap tokens between two different networks. 

By bridging networks, it enhances liquidity, efficiency, and accessibility within the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape, while also promoting the scalability and sustainability of blockchain technologies. Additionally, they enable users to leverage the unique features and capabilities of different blockchains, creating a more inclusive and interconnected digital economy.

## Traditional way of accessing other networks

Bridges provide a way to access other networks without having to go through a centralized exchange. This is important because centralized exchanges requires KYC that could take days depending on the amount of tokens you want to transfer, they are expensive and could be unreliable sometimes. They can also be hacked or shut down by regulators.


## Benefits of bridges
Bridges facilitate a multitude of applications by enabling blockchain networks to share data and transfer assets among themselves. They foster the growth of the broader crypto ecosystem by empowering blockchains to harness each other's innovations.

Developers benefit from bridges in the following ways:

- Enabling the transfer of data, information, and assets across multiple chains.
- Expanding the design space for protocols, thus introducing new features and use cases. For instance, a protocol initially deployed on Ethereum Mainnet for yield farming could extend its offerings to liquidity pools across all EVM-compatible chains.
- Leveraging the unique strengths of different blockchains. For instance, developers can take advantage of lower fees offered by various Layer 2 solutions by deploying their decentralized applications (dApps) across rollups and sidechains, with users bridging across them.
- Fostering collaboration among developers from diverse blockchain ecosystems to create innovative products.
- Drawing users and communities from various ecosystems to their dApps. For instance, a DeFi protocol deployed on Ethereum could attract users from Binance Smart Chain by offering cross-chain asset transfers through a bridge.

## Types of bridges
At a high level, bridges can be categorized as trusted and trustless.

{   /* Broad category */}

- **Oracle based bridges(Trusted)**: These are infrastructure solutions that enable interoperability and communication between disparate blockchain networks by leveraging external data sources known as oracles. These bridges facilitate the exchange of information and assets between blockchains that may have different protocols and consensus mechanisms. They rely on trusted set of accounts or entities to authorise and verify transactions and state transitions across interconnected networks.


- **Consensus based bridges(Trustless)**: These are infrastructure solutions that enables interoperability between different blockchain networks through a mechanism based on achieving consensus among the participating networks. Unlike oracle-based bridges, which rely on external data sources to facilitate communication between blockchains, consensus-based bridges use consensus algorithms to ensure the validity and integrity of transactions and state transitions across interconnected networks. This is the most secure way to connect two networks.


## Factors to consider when choosing a bridge
Bridges are susceptible to hacks, they are part of the top three biggest hacks in DEFI.

- **Speed**: In the domain of bridges, there's a fundamental trade-off between security and speed. Oracle-based bridges, which rely on trusted entities to verify transactions and state transitions across interconnected networks, boast faster transaction speeds. However, this expedited processing comes at the expense of security, leaving them susceptible to attacks and manipulation, such as the release of private keys. One key takeaway is, If the speed of message passing surpasses the consensus speed of interacting networks, the security isn't guaranteed by the networks' finality itself.

- **Security**: On the contrary, consensus-based bridges prioritize security over speed, leveraging consensus mechanisms amongst participating networks to validate transactions and ensure integrity. For instance, Hyperbridge operates on this model, where the time taken for asset bridging is contingent on the duration of consensus in the participating networks. This approach eliminates the need for trusted entities and instead relies on consensus proofs and state transition validity to communicate with other networks, thus preventing hacks and attacks. 

- **Connectivity**: What are the different destination chains a bridge can connect (i.e., rollups, sidechains, other layer 1 blockchains, etc.), and how hard is it to integrate a new blockchain? 
As it stands right now, Hyperbridge can bridge assets to Arbitrum, Base, Ethereum, BNB and any polkadot parachain in the future.

- **Send complex data**: A bridge should be able to transfer messages and more complex arbitrary data across chains and not just support cross-chain asset transfer. Hyperbridge gives connected chains the ability to not only do this but to also enact **actions**, also known as **intent** across destination chains.

- **Cost Effectiveness**: is a crucial factor when transferring assets across chains. Hyperbridge is meticulously crafted to ensure affordability and efficiency in such transactions.
