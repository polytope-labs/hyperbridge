# Requests

ISMP is a request-response protocol, modeled after HTTP. A _module_ on one state machine initiates a request which is to be executed by a counterpart _module_ on a different state machine. After processing the request, the recipient module may **optionally** generate a response, which is sent back to the original sender.

ISMP requests can be either POST or GET, similar to HTTP. A POST request indicates an intention to execute a transaction on the counterpart blockchain and carries an opaque payload intended for the destination ISMP module on the counterpart state machine. Conversely, a GET request aims to retrieve the values for the provided `keys` from the storage of a counterpart blockchain. Unlike a POST request, which must be delivered to the counterpart for processing, a GET request can be processed offchain by any interested party. Requests can also [time-out](/protocol/ismp/timeouts).

```rust showLineNumbers
/// The ISMP POST request.
pub struct Post {
    /// The source state machine of this request.
    pub source: StateMachine,
    /// The destination state machine of this request.
    pub dest: StateMachine,
    /// The nonce of this request on the source chain
    pub nonce: u64,
    /// Module identifier of the sending module
    pub from: Vec<u8>,
    /// Module identifier of the receiving module
    pub to: Vec<u8>,
    /// Unix timestamp by which this request expires in seconds.
    pub timeout_timestamp: u64,
    /// Encoded Request.
    pub data: Vec<u8>,
}

/// The ISMP GET request.
pub struct Get {
    /// The source state machine of this request.
    pub source: StateMachine,
    /// The destination state machine of this request.
    pub dest: StateMachine,
    /// The nonce of this request on the source chain
    pub nonce: u64,
    /// Module Id of the sending module
    pub from: Vec<u8>,
    /// Raw Storage keys that would be used to fetch the values from the counterparty
    /// For deriving storage keys for ink contract fields follow the guide in the link below
    /// https://use.ink/datastructures/storage-in-metadata#a-full-example
    /// The algorithms for calculating raw storage keys for different substrate pallet storage
    /// types are described in the following links

    /// For fetching keys from EVM contracts each key should be 52 bytes
    /// This should be a concatenation of contract address and slot hash
    pub keys: Vec<Vec<u8>>,
    /// Height at which to read the state machine.
    pub height: u64,
    /// Unix timestamp by which this request expires in seconds.
    pub timeout_timestamp: u64,

}/// The ISMP request.
pub enum Request {
    /// A post request allows a module on a state machine to send arbitrary bytes to another module
    /// living in another state machine.
    Post(Post),
    /// A get request allows a module on a state machine to read the storage of another module
    /// living in another state machine.
    Get(Get),
}

```

## Handlers

The ISMP framework exposes a handler that allows relayers submit new requests, alongside the necessary state proofs required for verification so that they may be executed by `IsmpModules`s

### `handle_post_request`

```rust showLineNumbers
/// The ISMP POST request.
pub struct Post {
    /// The source state machine of this request.
    pub source: StateMachine,
    /// The destination state machine of this request.
    pub dest: StateMachine,
    /// The nonce of this request on the source chain
    pub nonce: u64,
    /// Module Id of the sending module
    pub from: Vec<u8>,
    /// Module ID of the receiving module
    pub to: Vec<u8>,
    /// Unix timestamp which this request expires in seconds.
    pub timeout_timestamp: u64,
    /// Serialized request body.
    pub data: Vec<u8>,

}

/// A request message holds a batch of incoming requests and their proofs.
pub struct RequestMessage {
    /// POST requests from a source chain
    pub requests: Vec<Post>,
    /// Membership batch proof for these requests
    pub proof: Proof,
}

/// Handles incoming POST requests and dispatches them to the appropriate modules
pub fn handle_post_requests<H>(host: &H, msg: RequestMessage) -> Result<(), Error>
where
    H: IsmpHost,
{
  // .. implementation details
}
```

The `handle_post_requests` is used to notify onchain `IsmpModule`s of new requests to be processed. A relayer will construct the `RequestMessage` which holds a batch of new `Post` requests, as well as a _multi-proof_$^{[1]}$ of their existence on the source chain. The handler will perform the following operations

- Assert that the state machine's consensus client is not frozen
- Assert that the configured `challenge_period` for the `StateCommitment` has elapsed
- Assert that the requests have not been previously processed
- Assert that the requests have not timed out
- Assert that the membership proof for the requests verify
- Finally dispatch the requests to the relevant `IsmpModule::on_accept` and store a receipt for each request to prevent requests from being replayed.

:::danger
It's important to note that if the `IsmpModule::on_accept` does not return `Ok`, the receipt of this request will not be persisted, allowing the request to be **replayed**. Consequently, the `IsmpModule` is responsible for maintaining all invariants before modifying it's internal state to prevent partial state changes that could result in critical vulnerabilities in their request handler. This model ensures that if a request cannot be executed successfully on a destination state machine, it can time out gracefully on the source.
