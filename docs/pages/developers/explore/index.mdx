# Overview

Hyperbridge brings together advanced cryptographic and mechanistic protocols to facilitate secure cross-chain interoperability. The Hyperbridge protocol presents developers with a unified interface for the multi-chain that allows for the secure and trustless transfer of assets and data between different blockchains. It is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for the integration of new chains and protocols as the multi-chain ecosystem grows.

The protocol is facilitated by:

 - A permissionless set of relayers who transmit cross-chain messages authenticated by cryptographic proofs.
 - Hyperbridge Nexus, a blockchain that serves a crypto-economic coprocessor for interoperability proofs.
