# Running a Consensus Relayer

The Hyperbridge consensus relayer (tesseract) can be obtained through a variety of ways. For now only release artifacts for x86 linux environments are officially distributed.
Please note that building the Tesseract relayer from source is not supported at this time. The codebase includes private dependencies that are not publicly available, making it impossible to compile independently.

## Prebuilt binaries

You can install a prebuilt binary for the Tesseract consensus relayer with the following bash script

```bash
LATEST_TAG=$(curl -s https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/polytopelabs/tesseract-consensus/tags\?page_size\=1\&page\=2 | jq -r '.results[0].name')
wget -q --show-progress https://github.com/polytope-labs/hyperbridge/releases/download/tesseract-consensus-$LATEST_TAG/tesseract-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
tar -xvzf tesseract-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
# copy to $PATH
cp tesseract-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/tesseract $HOME/.local/bin/
```

or a 1-liner

```bash
LATEST_TAG=$(curl -s https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/polytopelabs/tesseract-consensus/tags\?page_size\=1\&page\=2 | jq -r '.results[0].name')
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/polytope-labs/hyperbridge/releases/download/tesseract-consensus-$LATEST_TAG/tesseract-installer.sh | sh
```

## Docker

Tesseract Consensus is available at the official docker repository [`polytopelabs/tesseract-consensus`](https://hub.docker.com/r/polytopelabs/tesseract-consensus)

```bash
docker pull polytopelabs/tesseract-consensus:latest
```

## Running the relayer

The tesseract consensus relayer command line interface expects two arguments, which are the paths to its configuration file and optional base state machine to use for consensus initialization.
If you're running it in a docker container, you will need to [map the directory](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/#start-a-container-with-a-bind-mount) where you've stored the configuration file on your host into the docker container.
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name=tesseract-consensus \
  --network=host \
  --restart=always \
  --volume=/dir/on/host:/home/root \
  polytopelabs/tesseract-consensus:latest \
  --config=/home/root/consensus-config.toml \
```


Access its logs using

```bash
docker logs -f tesseract-consensus
```

### System Requirements

At the minimum, the hyperbridge consensus relayer should be run on a machine with at least 4GB of RAM and a quad-core cpu. This relayer should also have at least a 100Mb/s connection if it is to query nodes over the internet.

## Configuration

The configuration file is a toml file at the moment, that expects the following configuration options:

```toml

```

You can obtain the required etherscan API key by following [this guide](https://docs.etherscan.io/getting-started/viewing-api-usage-statistics) for the appropriate network. Do note that since Ethereum and its L2s all use Ether as the gas token. They can all share the same etherscan API key.

### Contract addresses

You can find the addresses for the `IsmpHost` contracts for [mainnet](/developers/explore/configurations/mainnet) and [testnet](/developers/explore/configurations/testnet)
