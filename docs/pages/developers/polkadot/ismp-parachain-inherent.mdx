# ISMP Parachain Inherent Provider


This module leverages the [`ProvideInherent`](https://docs.rs/frame-support/latest/frame_support/inherent/trait.ProvideInherent.html) functionality to submit consensus update messages. This approach offers a significant advantage:

 - **Eliminating Off-chain Consensus Relayer** : By utilizing inherent messages for receiving consensus messages about finalized parachain block headers, the need for a separate off-chain consensus relayer is eliminated.
 - **Simplified Architecture** : This reduces the overall system complexity by removing an external component (the off-chain consensus relayer).
 - **Improved Efficiency** : Inherents are a built-in mechanism within the polkadot-sdk, allowing the collator to act as the consensus relayer.

The inherent provider module needs to be added to the collator's client subsystems as shown in the code below

```rust showLineNumbers
fn start_consensus(
    client: Arc<FullClient>,
    backend: Arc<FullBackend>,
    block_import: ParachainBlockImport,
    prometheus_registry: Option<&Registry>,
    telemetry: Option<TelemetryHandle>,
    task_manager: &TaskManager,
    relay_chain_interface: Arc<dyn RelayChainInterface>,
    transaction_pool: Arc<sc_transaction_pool::FullPool<opaque::Block, FullClient>>,
    sync_oracle: Arc<SyncingService<opaque::Block>>,
    keystore: KeystorePtr,
    relay_chain_slot_duration: Duration,
    para_id: ParaId,
    collator_key: CollatorPair,
    overseer_handle: OverseerHandle,
    announce_block: Arc<dyn Fn(opaque::Hash, Option<Vec<u8>>) + Send + Sync>,
) {
    // .. omitted calls

    let (client_clone, relay_chain_interface_clone) =
        (client.clone(), relay_chain_interface.clone());
    let params = lookahead::Params {
        create_inherent_data_providers: move |parent, ()| {
            let client = client_clone.clone();
            let relay_chain_interface = relay_chain_interface_clone.clone();
            async move {
                let inherent = ismp_parachain_inherent::ConsensusInherentProvider::create(
                    parent,
                    client,
                    relay_chain_interface,
                ).await?;

                Ok(inherent)
            }
        },
        ..Default::default()
        // omitted fields
    };

    // ..omitted calls
}
```
