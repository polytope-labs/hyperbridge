# Parachain Integration

Parachains that want to leverage the Hyperbridge protocol for secure cross-chain interoperability can do so by integrating the `ismp-parachain` pallet. This pallet empowers parachains to interoperate with whitelisted sibling parachains through the ISMP framework. 

## Runtime Integration

To establish a connection with Hyperbridge and utilize its message-passing capabilities, a parachain must complete three essential steps. First, it must integrate the `pallet-ismp` module into its runtime environment, providing the core functionalities for ISMP message handling. Next, the parachain must include the `ismp-parachain` pallet, which provides a parachain consensus client for verifying proofs of finalized parachain headers. Finally, the parachain must whitelist the Hyperbridge parachain on the `ismp-parachain` pallet.

### Parachain Consensus Client

The `ParachainConsensusClient` adds support for parachain consensus proofs to `pallet-ismp`. These consensus proofs once verified, finalize new parachain state commitments. This module will only verify proofs for parachains whose IDs have been previously whitelisted in the `ismp-parachain` pallet.

To include the pallet in the runtime, implement the pallet config for the Runtime and add the pallet to the `construct_runtime` macro.

```rust showLineNumbers
impl ismp_parachain::Config for Runtime {
    type RuntimeEvent = RuntimeEvent;
    // pallet-ismp implements the IsmpHost
    type IsmpHost = Ismp;
}

parameter_types! {
    // The hyperbridge parachain on Polkadot
    pub const Coprocessor: Option<StateMachine> = Some(StateMachine::Polkadot(3367));
}

impl pallet_ismp::Config for Runtime {
    // ...
    type Coprocessor = Coprocessor;
    type ConsensusClients = (
        // Add the parachain consensus clients to the supported consensus clients when configuring pallet-ismp
        ismp_parachain::ParachainConsensusClient<Runtime, IsmpParachain>,
    );
    // ...
}

construct_runtime! {
    // ...
    Ismp: pallet_ismp,
    IsmpParachain: ismp_parachain
}
```

### Whitelisting Parachains

To use the parachain consensus client to communicate with sibling parachains, Hyperbridge included. You will need to first whitelist these parachains using the `ismp_parachain::Call::<T>::add_parachain` extrinsic. Once added consenus relayers like the ismp parachain inherent will begin including finality proofs of these parachains in your runtime. Opening the doors of secure cross-chain communication.

## Calls

* ### `add_parachain`

This call allows a priviledged origin to add a new parachain to the list of connected parachains. When a new parachain is added, the inherent provider will add state proofs of the parachain's latest header into subsequent consensus messages. The arguments are: <br/>

&emsp;&emsp; 1. **id**: The parachain id of the sibling parachain. <br/>
&emsp;&emsp; 2. **slotDuration**: The slot duration in **milliseconds** for the sibling parachain.<br/>

* ### `update_parachain_consensus`
This is an inherent call that is used by the collator to include the consensus proofs for newly finalized parachain headers.

* ### `remove_parachain`
This priviledged call removes a parachain from the list of supported parachains, thereby preventing any future state updates from such parachain.

## Hooks

### on_initialize

In the OnInitialize hook, the consensus state for the parachain consensus client will be initialized if it does not exist.

### on_finalize

This hook is used to read the current relay chain state in order to get the state root of the finalized relay chain block, so it can be used to verify subsequent parachain consensus update messages.
