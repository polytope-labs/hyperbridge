# The Interoperable State Machine Protocol

The Interoperable State Machine Protocol (ISMP) is a lightweight, unopinionated messaging protocol designed to enable the development of cryptographically secure cross-chain applications. It employs the use of **consensus and state proofs to authorize cross-chain request execution**, providing a level of security equivalent to that of the underlying blockchains it connects.

ISMP is designed to have a very minimal API surface area. Its lightweight design means that ISMP is economically feasible even within expensive environments such as Ethereum. In addition, it offers a familiar and easy-to-understand message-passing mechanism that mimcs the already standardized HTTP protocol.
<br />
The core of ISMP lies in its use of [Consensus clients](/protocol/consensus). These clients enable the protocol to obtain the finalized, irreversible state of a connected blockchain. Another key component is the [State machine client](/protocol/state-machine), which allows it to read the outgoing messages stored in the state trie of a connected blockchain. The system also uses a [Router](/protocol/router) to direct messages to their destination modules on a host chain.

For modules that need to send cross-chain [_requests_](/protocol/requests), they can utilize the [Dispatcher](/protocol/dispatcher) to send both POST and GET requests.
