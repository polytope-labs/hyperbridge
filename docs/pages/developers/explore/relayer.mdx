Relayers are the backbone of the Hyperbridge network, responsible for facilitating all cross-chain interactions. In a departure from many interoperability protocols, Hyperbridge's relayer ecosystem is fundamentally **permissionless**. This means any operator can participate without needing to be staked or whitelisted, fostering a decentralized, robust, and censorship-resistant environment.

While united by this core philosophy, relayers in Hyperbridge perform two distinct but interconnected roles: **Consensus Relaying** and **Message Relaying**. Understanding the difference between them is key to understanding how Hyperbridge functions.

## Shared Principles: A Free Market Design

Before diving into their differences, it's important to recognize the principles that govern both relayer types:

* **Fully Permissionless**: No staking or approval is required to operate. This lowers the barrier to entry and maximizes decentralization.
* **Economically Incentivized**: Relayers are not altruistic; they are compensated for the vital services they provide to the network.
* **Competitive**: Both systems are designed as a free-market race. The most efficient and fastest relayers are the most likely to capture economic rewards, which ensures high performance and liveness for the entire network.

## The Two Relayer Roles

While they operate within the same permissionless framework, the two relayer types have fundamentally different goals, incentives, and operational flows.

### Consensus Relayers: The Network Notaries

The primary goal of a **Consensus Relayer** is to provide **finality proofs**. They act as decentralized notaries, observing the finalized state of one blockchain and submitting a verifiable cryptographic proof of that state to Hyperbridge or any destination chain.

This service is a **public good**; it keeps Hyperbridge's view of all connected chains fresh and accurate. Without this constant stream of consensus updates, secure cross-chain communication would be impossible. For providing this foundational service, consensus relayers are rewarded directly by the Hyperbridge protocol from its treasury with native `$BRIDGE` tokens.

### Messaging Relayers: The Cross-Chain Couriers

A **Messaging Relayer** acts as a courier, responsible for delivering specific user-initiated requests and responses between chains. Their job begins only *after* a Consensus Relayer has provided the necessary finality proof for the block containing the user's message.

This service is funded directly by the end-user or application. When dispatching a message, a user attaches a fee (in a stablecoin like `DAI`) to pay for the cost of delivery and execution on the destination chain. Messaging relayers compete to deliver these messages, covering the gas costs upfront and claiming the user-provided fee as their reward.

## At a Glance: Consensus Relaying vs. Messaging Relaying

| Feature               | Consensus Relayer                                      | Messaging Relayer                                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Primary Role** | Provide finality proofs for an entire chain.         | Deliver specific user messages and data payloads.      |
| **Service Type** | A public good for the entire network.                  | A private service for an individual user's transaction.  |
| **Incentive Source** | Protocol-issued rewards from the Hyperbridge Treasury. | User-paid fees attached to each message.               |
| **Reward Currency** | `$BRIDGE` (Native Token)                               | `DAI` (Stablecoin)                                     |
| **Triggers Action** | A new block is finalized on a connected chain.         | A user dispatches a message with an attached fee.      |
| **Core Relationship** | **Enabler**: Provides the security foundation.         | **Consumer**: Depends on the state provided by consensus. |
