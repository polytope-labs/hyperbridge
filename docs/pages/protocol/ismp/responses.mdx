# Responses

Responses in the ISMP framework can be either one of a `PostResponse` or a `GetResponse`.

```rust showLineNumbers
/// The response to a POST request
pub struct PostResponse {
    /// The POST request that triggered this response.
    pub post: Post,
    /// The response message.
    pub response: Vec<u8>,
    /// Unix timestamp at which this response expires in seconds.
    pub timeout_timestamp: u64,
}

/// The response to a GET request
pub struct GetResponse {
    /// The Get request that triggered this response.
    pub get: Get,
    /// Key-Values derived from the state proof
    pub values: BTreeMap<Vec<u8>, Option<Vec<u8>>>,
}

/// The ISMP response
pub enum Response {
    /// The response to a POST request
    Post(PostResponse),
    /// The response to a GET request
    Get(GetResponse),
}
```

## `PostResponse`

A `PostResponse` can be seen as the result or return value of a `PostRequest` execution. `IsmpModule`s may opt not to generate a `PostResponse`, and instead employ an optimistic model. In this model, the module state is altered before the request is dispatched, in such a way that **it can be reverted** if the request times out. This approach reduces considerable message round trip and verification expenses, providing a better user experience. However, when it's necessary to give the caller an execution result, the ISMP framework allows for a `PostResponse`. The `PostResponse`, much like a `PostRequest` can also [time-out](/protocol/ismp/timeouts).

## `GetResponse`

A `GetResponse` provides the requested storage values of a `GetRequest`, it contains a map of the requested key-value pairs. These values may be null, in which case they are represented as `Option::None`. The key-value pairs are derived from the state proof verification of the values at the given `height`. This verification is performed using the `StateMachineClient` of the destination `StateMachine`.

## Handlers

The ISMP framework exposes a handler that allows relayers submit new responses, alongside the necessary state proofs required for verification so that they may be executed by `IsmpModules`s

### `handle_response`

```rust showLineNumbers
/// A request message holds a batch of responses to be dispatched from a source state machine
pub struct ResponseMessage {
    /// A set of either POST requests or responses to be handled
    pub datagram: RequestResponse,
    /// Membership batch proof for these req/res
    pub proof: Proof,
}

/// Validate the state machine, verify the response message and dispatch the message to the router
pub fn handle_response<H>(host: &H, msg: ResponseMessage) -> Result<(), Error>
where
    H: IsmpHost,
{
    // .. implementation details
}
```

The `handle_response` is used to notify onchain `IsmpModule`s of new responses to be processed. A relayer will construct the `ResponseMessage` which holds a batch of new responses, and their relevant proofs. The handler will perform the following operations

- Assert that the state machine's consensus client is not frozen
- Assert that the configured `challenge_period` for the `StateCommitment` has elapsed
- Assert that the responses have not been previously processed
- Assert that the responses have not timed out
- Assert that the proofs for the responses verify
- Finally dispatch the responses to the relevant `IsmpModule::on_response` and store a receipt for each responses to prevent responses from being replayed.

:::danger
It's important to note that if the `IsmpModule::on_response` does not return `Ok`, the receipt of this response will not be persisted, allowing the response to be **replayed**. Consequently, the `IsmpModule` is responsible for maintaining all invariants before modifying it's internal state to prevent partial state changes that could result in critical vulnerabilities in their response handler. This model ensures that if a response cannot be executed successfully on a destination state machine, it can time out gracefully on the source.
