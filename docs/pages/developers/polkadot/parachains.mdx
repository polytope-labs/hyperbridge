# Parachain Integration

There are a few steps to integrate hyperbridge with a parachain. This section  will guide you through everything you need.  

## Parachain State Updates

This module empowers parachains to interact with whitelisted sibling parachains. Here's how it works:

**Registration** : A parachain can register the IDs of sibling parachains whose state roots it requires to access.  
**Inherent Mechanism** : The functionality relies on an inherent provider and inherent extrinsics:  
    * **Whitelisted Parachains** : This inherent provider reads the ismp-parachain pallet for a list of currently supported parachain IDs.
    * **State Proof Fetching** : The provider then retrieves the latest headers from the relay chain for each supported parachain. Additionally, it fetches state proofs for these headers, which act as cryptographic evidence of the header's validity.
    * **Consensus Message Submission** : Finally, the provider submits a consensus message as an inherent extrinsic. This message includes the retrieved state proofs.
    * **Verification** : The `ParachainConsensusClient`, integrated with `pallet-ismp`, verifies the submitted consensus message and its proofs.

## Pallet Config

The pallet has the following configuration

```rust
    #[pallet::config]
	pub trait Config:
		frame_system::Config + pallet_ismp::Config + cumulus_pallet_parachain_system::Config
	{
		/// The overarching event type
		type RuntimeEvent: From<Event<Self>> + IsType<<Self as frame_system::Config>::RuntimeEvent>;

		/// The underlying [`IsmpHost`] implementation
		type IsmpHost: IsmpHost + Default;
	}
```
## Efficient Parachain Consensus Updates via Inherents

This pallet leverages the `ProvideInherent` functionality to submit consensus update messages. This approach offers a significant advantage:

**Eliminating Off-chain Consensus Relayer** : By utilizing inherent messages for receiving consensus messages about finalized parachain block headers, the need for a separate off-chain consensus relayer is eliminated.  
    **Benefits** :
        *   **Simplified Architecture** : This reduces the overall system complexity by removing an external component (the off-chain consensus relayer).
        *   **Improved Efficiency** : Inherents are a built-in mechanism within the polkadot-sdk, allowing the collator to act as the consensus relayer.

## Pallet calls

* `update_parachain_consensus`
This is an inherent call that is used by the collator to include the consensus update message for the parachain consensus client.

* `add_parachain`
This call allows a priviledged origin to add a new parachain to the list of supported parachains. whenever a new parachain is added, the inherent provider will add state proofs of the parachain's latest header in subsequent consensus messages.  

* `remove_parachain`
This priviledged call removes a parachain from the list of supported parachains, thereby preventing any future state updates from such parachain.  

## LifeCycle

### OnInitialize

In the OnInitialize hook, the consensus state for the parachain consensus client will be initialized if it does not exist.


### OnFinalize

This hook is used to read the current relay chain state in order to get the state root of the finalized relay chain block, so it can be used to verify subsequent parachain consensus update messages.  

## Parachain Consensus Client and ISMP Integration
**Parachain Consensus Client**:  

 It's specifically designed to verify consensus update messages received from the inherent provider. These messages contain:  
    *   **State Proofs**: These proofs confirm the inclusion of whitelisted parachain block headers (considered valid) within the most recently finalized relay chain head.

For a parachain to establish a connection with Hyperbridge and leverage its message-passing capabilities, two key steps are required:

**Include pallet-ismp** : The first step involves integrating the pallet-ismp module into the parachain's runtime environment as described in a previous section. This module provides the foundational functionalities for ISMP message handling.
**Include ismp-parachain** : Subsequently, the parachain needs to include the ismp-parachain pallet. This additional module grants the parachain access to the state commitments of whitelisted parachains. Access to these commitments is essential for verifying the validity of messages that the parachain intends to send or receive to/from Hyperbridge.

## Adding the ismp-parachain to the runtime

To include the pallet in the runtime, implement the pallet config for the Runtime and add the pallet to the `construct_runtime` macro.

```rust
   impl ismp_parachain::Config for Runtime {
        type RuntimeEvent = RuntimeEvent;
        // pallet-ismp implements the IsmpHost
        type IsmpHost = Ismp;
   }

   parameter_types! {
        // The hyperbridge parachain on Polkadot
        pub const Coprocessor: Option<StateMachine> = Some(StateMachine::Polkadot(3367));
   }

   impl pallet_ismp::Config for Runtime {
        // ...
        type Coprocessor = Coprocessor;
        type ConsensusClients = (
            // Add the parachain consensus clients to the supported consensus clients when configuring pallet-ismp
            ismp_parachain::ParachainConsensusClient<Runtime, IsmpParachain>,
        );
        // ...
   }

   construct_runtime! {
    // ...
    Ismp: pallet_ismp,
    IsmpParachain: ismp_parachain
   }
```

The inherent provider requires a runtime api to read the pallet state

```rust
    impl ismp_parachain_runtime_api::IsmpParachainApi<Block> for Runtime {
		fn para_ids() -> Vec<u32> {
			IsmpParachain::para_ids()
		}

		fn current_relay_chain_state() -> RelayChainState {
			IsmpParachain::current_relay_chain_state()
		}
	}
```

## Adding the inherent provider to the node

The inherent provider needs to be added to the collator params as shown in the code below

```rust
fn start_consensus(
    client: Arc<FullClient>,
    backend: Arc<FullBackend>,
    block_import: ParachainBlockImport,
    prometheus_registry: Option<&Registry>,
    telemetry: Option<TelemetryHandle>,
    task_manager: &TaskManager,
    relay_chain_interface: Arc<dyn RelayChainInterface>,
    transaction_pool: Arc<sc_transaction_pool::FullPool<opaque::Block, FullClient>>,
    sync_oracle: Arc<SyncingService<opaque::Block>>,
    keystore: KeystorePtr,
    relay_chain_slot_duration: Duration,
    para_id: ParaId,
    collator_key: CollatorPair,
    overseer_handle: OverseerHandle,
    announce_block: Arc<dyn Fn(opaque::Hash, Option<Vec<u8>>) + Send + Sync>,
) {
    // .. omitted calls

    let (client_clone, relay_chain_interface_clone) =
        (client.clone(), relay_chain_interface.clone());
    let params = lookahead::Params {
        create_inherent_data_providers: move |parent, ()| {
            let client = client_clone.clone();
            let relay_chain_interface = relay_chain_interface_clone.clone();
            async move {
                let inherent = ismp_parachain_inherent::ConsensusInherentProvider::create(
                    parent,
                    client,
                    relay_chain_interface,
                ).await?;

                Ok(inherent)
            }
        },
        ..Default::default()
        // omitted fields
    };
    
    // ..omitted calls
}
```

## Connecting Your Parachain to Hyperbridge

Integrating your parachain with Hyperbridge is a straightforward process. Here's what you need to do:

**Add Hyperbridge's Parachain ID** : Include Hyperbridge's unique parachain identifier (ID), which is `3367`, in the list of supported parachain IDs within the `ismp-parachain` pallet. This grants your parachain the ability to communicate with Hyperbridge.  
Call the `add_parachain` Extrinsic with the admin origin setup in `palet-ismp`. This action officially adds Hyperbridge to your list of supported parachains.  

Once these steps are completed, your parachain will be empowered to send and receive messages to and from Hyperbridge, enabling seamless cross-chain communication.
