# Dispatching Requests & Responses

This section explores the means by which pallets may leverage Hyperbridge to dispatch cross-chain messages. It's important to understand that in Hyperbridge protocol, there are 3 different kinds of cross-chain messages. We'll explore each of them Below.

## POST Requests

A POST request is simply a cross-chain message to be executed by some `IIsmpModule` on a destination. A POST request may also timeout, potentially as a result of liveness failures of the destination chain or failure to execute the message successfully. Through this mechanism, modules can "catch" this failure similar to the try/catch pattern and handle the failure case in the `on_timeout` callback.


```rust showLineNumbers
pub struct DispatchPost {
    pub dest: StateMachine,
    pub from: Vec<u8>,
    pub to: Vec<u8>,
    pub timeout: u64,
    pub body: Vec<u8>,
}

struct FeeMetadata<T> {
    pub payer: <T as Config>::AccountId,
    pub fee: <T as Config>::Balance,
}

pub enum DispatchRequest {
    Post(DispatchPost),
    Get(DispatchGet),
}

trait IsmpDispatcher  {
    fn dispatch_request(
        &self,
        request: DispatchRequest,
        fee: FeeMetadata<T>,
    ) -> Result<H256, Error>;

    // ...
}
```

### Dispatch Parameters

- `dest`: Destination chain, for this you'll use the `StateMachine` enum eg `StateMachine::Evm(1)` for Ethereum Mainnet.
- `from`: The initiaing module identifier on the source chain.
- `to`: Receiving module/contract address on the destination chain.
- `body`: Serialized byte representation of the message (to be decoded by the receiving contract).
- `timeout`: Time in seconds for message validity eg 3600 for a timeout of 1 hour, or 0 for no timeout. ie Messages will never expire. If the timeout is set to a non-zero value, messages that have exceeded this timeout will be rejected on the destination and require user action
  (timeout message) to revert changes.
- `fee`: Optional relayer fees, should only be used if `pallet-hyperbridge` is the `IsmpDispatcher`. This can be set to zero if the application developers or users prefer to self-relay. If not this will withdraw the provided fee from the `Currency` implementation configured on `pallet-ismp`.
- `payer`: The account that should receive a refund of the relayer fees if the request times out.

```rust showLineNumbers
#[pallet::weight(T::dispatch())]
#[pallet::call_index(0)]
pub fn send_message(
    origin: OriginFor<T>,
    post: DispatchPost,
    fee: T::Balance,
) -> DispatchResultWithPostInfo {
    let signer = ensure_signed(origin)?;
    let dispatcher = pallet_ismp::Pallet::<Runtime>::default();
    let commitment = dispatcher.dispatch_request(
        DispatchRequest::Post(post),
        FeeMetadata {
            payer: signer,
            fee,
        }
    )?;

    Ok(())
}
```

## POST Responses

Dispatching a POST response, going by it's name is, well, a response to a previously received POST request. Dispatching a POST response requires that the module has indeed received a post request from a counterparty chain in a previous transaction.

```rust showLineNumbers
pub struct PostResponse {
    pub post: PostRequest,
    pub response: Vec<u8>,
    pub timeout_timestamp: u64,
}

trait IsmpDispatcher {
    fn dispatch_response(
        &self,
        request: PostResponse,
        fee: FeeMetadata<T>,
    ) -> Result<H256, Error>;

    // ...
}
```
### Dispatch Parameters

- `post`: The previously received request object. The full object is required to authenticate if the response is eligible for dispatch.
- `response`: Serialized byte representation of the response message (to be decoded by the receiving contract).
- `timeout_timestamp`: Time in seconds for message validity eg 3600 for a timeout of 1 hour, or 0 for no timeout. ie Messages will never expire. If the timeout is set to a non-zero value, messages that have exceeded this timeout will be rejected on the destination and require user action
  (timeout message) to revert changes.
- `fee`: Optional relayer fees, should only be used if `pallet-hyperbridge` is the `IsmpDispatcher`. This can be set to zero if the application developers or users prefer to self-relay. If not this will withdraw the provided fee from the `Currency` implementation configured on `pallet-ismp`.
- `payer`: The account that should receive a refund of the relayer fees if the request times out.

```rust showLineNumbers
#[pallet::weight(T::dispatch())]
#[pallet::call_index(0)]
pub fn send_response(
    origin: OriginFor<T>,
    request: PostRequest,
    fee: T::Balance,
) -> DispatchResultWithPostInfo {
    let signer = ensure_signed(origin)?;
    let dispatcher = pallet_ismp::Pallet::<Runtime>::default();
    let commitment = dispatcher.dispatch_response(
        PostResponse {
            post: request, 
            response: *b"Hello there".to_vec(),
            timeout_timestamp: 0, // no timeout
        },
        FeeMetadata {
            payer: signer,
            fee,
        }
    )?;

    Ok(())
}
```

## GET Requests

GET requests allow modules to perform asynchronous reads of a counterparty blockchain's state. This can be used to read either the [`Account`](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/tree/master/packages/util#module-account) object, which is stored in the world state, or even storage slots in a contract storage. Eg reading the price of a Uniswap pair on a remote chain.

When dispatching get requests, you specify the storage keys you need to read and the block height at which you need to read these storage entries.

```rust showLineNumbers
pub struct DispatchGet {
    pub dest: StateMachine,
    pub from: Vec<u8>,
    pub keys: Vec<Vec<u8>>,
    pub height: u64,
    pub context: Vec<u8>,
    pub timeout: u64,
}

struct FeeMetadata<T> {
    pub payer: <T as Config>::AccountId,
    pub fee: <T as Config>::Balance,
}

pub enum DispatchRequest {
    Post(DispatchPost),
    Get(DispatchGet),
}

trait IsmpDispatcher  {
    fn dispatch_request(
        &self,
        request: DispatchRequest,
        fee: FeeMetadata<T>,
    ) -> Result<H256, Error>;
    // ...
}
```

### Dispatch Parameters

- `dest`: The chain whose database should be read (e.g., `StateMachine::Evm(1)` for Ethereum Mainnet).
- `from`: The initiaing module identifier on the source chain.
- `height`: Block height at which the provided keys should be fetched.
- `keys`: Storage keys whose values should be fetched and verified.
- `timeout`: Time in seconds for message validity eg 3600 for a timeout of 1 hour, or 0 for no timeout. ie Messages will never expire. If the timeout is set to a non-zero value, messages that have exceeded this timeout will be rejected on the destination and require user action
  (timeout message) to revert changes.
- `fee`: Hyperbridge protocol fees for processing the request. This should only be used if `pallet-hyperbridge` is the `IsmpDispatcher`. If non-zero this will withdraw the provided fee from the `Currency` implementation configured on `pallet-ismp`.
- `payer`: The account initiating this request.


```rust showLineNumbers
#[pallet::weight(T::dispatch())]
#[pallet::call_index(0)]
pub fn read_state(
    origin: OriginFor<T>,
    get: DispatchGet,
    fee: T::Balance,
) -> DispatchResultWithPostInfo {
    let signer = ensure_signed(origin)?;
    let dispatcher = pallet_ismp::Pallet::<Runtime>::default();
    let commitment = dispatcher.dispatch_request(
        DispatchRequest::Get(get),
        FeeMetadata {
            payer: signer,
            fee,
        }
    )?;

    Ok(())
}
```

In the next section we'll look at how Hyperbridge collects it's fees.
