# Bridges

The web3 ecosystem is made up of a diverse array of blockchain networks, each with its own unique features, capabilities, and use cases. While this diversity is a key strength of the web3 ecosystem, it also presents challenges in terms of interoperability and communication between different networks. This is where bridges come in.

## What are bridges?

Bridges are fundamentally crucial to the suceess of web3, they give users the power to exchange information and transact freely. They remove the need to go through a centralized exchange to swap tokens between two different networks. 

By bridging networks, Web3 bridges enhance liquidity, efficiency, and accessibility within the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape, while also promoting the scalability and sustainability of blockchain technologies. Additionally, they enable users to leverage the unique features and capabilities of different blockchains, creating a more inclusive and interconnected digital economy.

## Traditional way of accessing other networks

Bridges provide a way to access other networks without having to go through a centralized exchange. This is important because centralized exchanges requires KYC that could take days depending on the amount of tokens you want to transfer, they are expensive and could be unreliable sometimes. They can also be hacked or shut down by regulators.



## Types of bridges
{  /* Broad category */}

- **Oracle based bridges**: These are infrastructure solutions that enable interoperability and communication between disparate blockchain networks by leveraging external data sources known as oracles. These bridges facilitate the exchange of information and assets between blockchains that may have different protocols and consensus mechanisms. They rely on trusted set of accounts or entities to authorise and verify transactions and state transitions across interconnected networks.


- **Consensus based bridges**: These are infrastructure solutions that enables interoperability between different blockchain networks through a mechanism based on achieving consensus among the participating networks. Unlike oracle-based bridges, which rely on external data sources to facilitate communication between blockchains, consensus-based bridges use consensus algorithms to ensure the validity and integrity of transactions and state transitions across interconnected networks. This is the most secure way to connect two networks.


## Security Vs Speed
In the domain of bridges, there's a fundamental trade-off between security and speed. Oracle-based bridges, which rely on trusted entities to verify transactions and state transitions across interconnected networks, boast faster transaction speeds. However, this expedited processing comes at the expense of security, leaving them susceptible to attacks and manipulation, such as the release of private keys. However, if the speed of message passing surpasses the consensus speed of interacting networks, the security isn't guaranteed by the networks' finality itself.

On the contrary, consensus-based bridges prioritize security over speed, leveraging consensus mechanisms among participating networks to validate transactions and ensure integrity. For instance, Hyperbridge operates on this model, where the time taken for asset bridging is contingent on the consensus duration of the participating networks. This approach eliminates the need for trusted entities and instead relies on consensus proofs and state transition validity to communicate with other networks.
