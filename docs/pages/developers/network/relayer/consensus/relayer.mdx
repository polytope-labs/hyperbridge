# Running a Consensus Relayer

The Hyperbridge consensus relayer (tesseract) can be obtained through a variety of ways. For now only release artifacts for x86 linux environments are officially distributed.
Please note that building the Tesseract relayer from source is not supported at this time. The codebase includes private dependencies that are not publicly available, making it impossible to compile independently.

## Prebuilt binaries

You can install a prebuilt binary for the Tesseract consensus relayer with the following bash script

```bash
LATEST_TAG=$(curl -s https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/polytopelabs/tesseract-consensus/tags\?page_size\=1\&page\=2 | jq -r '.results[0].name')
wget -q --show-progress https://github.com/polytope-labs/hyperbridge/releases/download/tesseract-consensus-$LATEST_TAG/tesseract-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
tar -xvzf tesseract-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
# copy to $PATH
cp tesseract-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/tesseract $HOME/.local/bin/
```

or a 1-liner

```bash
LATEST_TAG=$(curl -s https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/polytopelabs/tesseract-consensus/tags\?page_size\=1\&page\=2 | jq -r '.results[0].name')
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/polytope-labs/hyperbridge/releases/download/tesseract-consensus-$LATEST_TAG/tesseract-installer.sh | sh
```

## Docker

Tesseract Consensus is available at the official docker repository [`polytopelabs/tesseract-consensus`](https://hub.docker.com/r/polytopelabs/tesseract-consensus)

```bash
docker pull polytopelabs/tesseract-consensus:latest
```

## Running the relayer

The tesseract consensus relayer command line interface expects two arguments, which are the paths to its configuration file and optional base state machine to use for consensus initialization.
If you're running it in a docker container, you will need to [map the directory](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/#start-a-container-with-a-bind-mount) where you've stored the configuration file on your host into the docker container.
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name=tesseract-consensus \
  --network=host \
  --restart=always \
  --volume=/dir/on/host:/home/root \
  polytopelabs/tesseract-consensus:latest \
  --config=/home/root/consensus-config.toml \
```


Access its logs using

```bash
docker logs -f tesseract-consensus
```

### System Requirements

At the minimum, the hyperbridge consensus relayer should be run on a machine with at least 4GB of RAM and a quad-core cpu. This relayer should also have at least a 100Mb/s connection if it is to query nodes over the internet.

## Configuration

The tesseract relayer is configured using a single consensus-config.toml file. The structure is designed to be modular: you start with a base configuration that is always required,
and then append the configuration blocks for each network you wish to relay.

### Base configuration (Required)

```toml
# Hyperbridge consensus client config, required.
# This section defines how the relayer connects to and interprets the Hyperbridge chain.
[hyperbridge]
# Specifies the consensus mechanism of the Hyperbridge chain.
# "grandpa" is used for Substrate-based chains utilizing the GRANDPA finality gadget.
# "beefy" is used for chains utilizing the BEEFY finality gadget
type = "grandpa"

# Configuration specific to the GRANDPA consensus client.
[hyperbridge.grandpa]
# The WebSocket RPC endpoint for a Standalone or Relay Chain.
rpc = "wss://polkadot-rpc.n.dwellir.com"

# The expected time duration for a block slot in milliseconds.
slot_duration = 6000

# (Optional) How often to query for consensus updates. This is in seconds
consensus_update_frequency = 60

# A list of parachain IDs that are connected to this relay chain and should be monitored.
para_ids = [3367]

# Configuration for the Hyperbridge parachain itself.
[hyperbridge.substrate]
# The WebSocket RPC endpoint for the Hyperbridge parachain.
rpc_ws = "wss://nexus.ibp.network"

# The hashing algorithm used by the parachain. Can be "Keccak" or "Blake2".
hashing = "Keccak"

# The consensus state identifier for Hyperbridge itself.
# For Hyperbridge Mainnet, this is "DOT0" and "PASO" for Paseo Testnet.
consensus_state_id = "DOT0"

# The state machine identifier for the Hyperbridge parachain.
# state_machine = "KUSAMA-4009" # Hyperbridge parachain testnet Testnet
state_machine = "POLKADOT-3367"


# Relayer account seed. This can be generated using subkey
signer = "YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY"


# Relayer-specific configuration.
[relayer]
# A list of maximum update intervals for specific chains.
# This is The maximum interval in seconds allowed between consensus updates for each state machine
# before the process should be restarted.
maximum_update_intervals = [
    [{ state_id = "EVM-1", consensus_state_id = "ETH0"}, 900],
    [{ state_id = "EVM-100", consensus_state_id = "GNO0"}, 420],
    [{ state_id = "EVM-56", consensus_state_id = "BSC0"}, 300],
]

# Controls whether the relayer should start Hyperbridge consensus task
enable_hyperbridge_consensus = false
```

### Add Network Configurations

Before running the relayer, please review your configuration file and ensure you have replaced all placeholder values.

#### Important Check list

- `YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY`: Your Hyperbridge account's(controller) private key, can be generated using subkey. Relayer incentives in BRIDGE tokens will be paid to this account, it should also be the same key used in the messaging relayer.
- `SIGNER-KEY`: Your EVM account's hex-encoded private key.
- `API-KEY`: Your Etherscan API key. You can obtain the required etherscan v2 API key by following [this guide](https://docs.etherscan.io/). Do note that all EVM chains share the same etherscan API key.
- All contract addresses in the docs have the correct mainnet values and should not be changed.
- Replace all rpc urls with highly reliable rpc endpoints for each network


### Contract addresses

You can find the addresses for the `IsmpHost` contracts for [mainnet](/developers/explore/configurations/mainnet) and [testnet](/developers/explore/configurations/testnet)
