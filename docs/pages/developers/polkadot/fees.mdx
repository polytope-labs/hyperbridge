# Hyperbridge Fees

For parachains and solochains that intend to send messages through Hyperbridge it is required that they make protocol fee payments for each request and response dispatched.
Hyperbridge will only accept messages with state proofs of protocol fee payments, we provide a pallet that handles this.

## Pallet Hyperbridge

This pallet provides an Ismp dispatcher that handles protocol fee collection, it must be added to the runtime of any substrate chain that wishes to use Hyperbridge as a Coprocessor.
Protocol fees are charged per byte of data in the request or response body.

The pallet implements `IsmpModule` that must be integrated with your `IsmpRouter` implementation, this module allows this pallet receive parameter updates from hyperbridge and also process relayer fee withdrawals.

```rust showLineNumbers
impl pallet_hyperbridge::Config for Runtime {
    type RuntimeEvent = RuntimeEvent;
    // pallet-ismp implements the IsmpHost
    type IsmpHost = Ismp;
}

// ...

construct_runtime! {
    // ...
    Ismp: pallet_ismp,
    Hyperbridge: pallet_hyperbridge
}

#[derive(Default)]
struct ModuleRouter;

impl IsmpRouter for ModuleRouter {
    fn module_for_id(&self, id: Vec<u8>) -> Result<Box<dyn IsmpModule>, Error> {
        return match id.as_slice() {
            PALLET_HYPERBRIDGE_ID => Ok(Box::new(pallet_hyperbridge::Pallet::<Runtime>::default())),
            // ... other modules
            _   => Err(Error::ModuleNotFound(id)),
        };
    }
}
```

## Protocol Fees

Hyperbridge charges a non-refundable protocol fee per byte of the request/response body. This fee is withdrawn from the user account that dispatched the request.


## Relayer Fees

The relayer fee is an optional incentive provided by users initiating cross-chain transactions. It compensates Hyperbridge's decentralized relayers for delivering messages to the destination chain.

### Components
The fee consists of two parts:
* Gas fee
    This covers the cost of executing the message on the destination chain.
* Relayer service fee
    This additional amount rewards relayers for their services.
    Relayers are profit-Driven mediators and they will prioritize messages with fees that ensure profitability.

#### Setting the Fee
To account for potential gas price fluctuations during message delivery, consider the following:
* Proof verification gas cost
    Base the fee on the typical gas required for state proof verification (around 120k gas in USD equivalent).
* Message execution gas cost
    The usd equivalent for the gas cost of executing the message
* Gas price buffer
    Include a buffer to accommodate gas price spikes.
* Relayer service charge
    Factor in a reasonable amount to compensate relayers.
* Self-Relay Option
    Users can choose to self-relay messages by omitting the relayer fee.
