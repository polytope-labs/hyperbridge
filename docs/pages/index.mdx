# Introduction

Secure interoperability requires the verification of consensus proofs, consensus fault proofs, and state transition validity proofs. Blockchains that want to securely communicate with each other must perform these operations onchain, so that they can be convinced of the finalized (irreversible) state of their counterparty. Finally, through the use of state proofs, they are then able to read the outgoing message queue of their counter party.

These operations are very expensive and do not scale when we especially want to facilitate the communication of multiple blockchains. This neccessitates the coprocessor model where computations must be performed offchain and reported back onchain with cryptographic proofs of the correct execution.

Hyperbrige is an instance of such a coprocessor. More formally, it is a [crypto-economic coprocessor](https://blog.polytope.technology/cryptoeconomic-coprocessors). These types of coprocessors simply put, are blockchains that leverage their [consensus proofs](https://research.polytope.technology/consensus-proofs) to attest to the correctness of the **computations performed onchain**. As a result, they are more decentralized, fault-tolerant, uncensorable and most importantly, unstoppable.
