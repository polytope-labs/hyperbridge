# Hyperbridge Glossary

# Coprocessor

Off-chain computation is carried out, and the outcomes are subsequently showcased on-chain, accompanied by cryptographic evidence of their accurate execution.

# Address

This is a 32 byte long value that is used to identify an account on the blockchain.

# Beefy

The BEEFY protocol complements GRANDPA in Polkadot by facilitating efficient bridging with external blockchains like Ethereum. It allows participants in these external networks to verify finality proofs from Polkadot validators, enabling Ethereum users to confirm Polkadot's current state.


# Consensus

Consensus is the collective agreement or alignment reached among participants within a group or network regarding specific decisions or states.

# Consensus Proofs
This typically refer to cryptographic evidence or protocols that demonstrate agreement among participants in a decentralized network

# Consensus fault Proofs
This refers to cryptographic evidence or protocols that demonstrate when a fault or inconsistency occurs within the consensus mechanism of a decentralized network.

# State Witness

This is the current state or history of the blockchain before the state transition is executed.

# Parachains

Polkadot parachains are specialized, independent blockchains that connect to the Polkadot network, a multi-chain ecosystem designed for interoperability and scalability. Parachains operate alongside the main Polkadot relay chain, each with its own set of rules, governance, and token economics.

# KYC

Know Your Customer (KYC) is a process that businesses and financial institutions implement to verify the identity of their clients or customers. This process is used to prevent fraud, money laundering, and other illegal activities.

# State Machine Proofs

State machine proofs is a cryptographic verification technique used to ensure the correctness and consistency of state transitions within a state machine.

# Merkle trie

Also referred to as a Merkle tree, is a data structure utilized in computer science and cryptography to efficiently store and verify the integrity of extensive datasets

# Merkle proof

A Merkle proof is a cryptographic proof that verifies the integrity of a specific piece of data within a Merkle tree or trie.

# StateMachine
A state machine interprets a series of inputs and transitions to a new state depending on those inputs. Each state represents the current condition of a system as it awaits the execution of a transition. A transition comprises a series of actions that are carried out when a specific condition is met or an event is triggered.

# Epochs
An epoch is a time duration in the BABE protocol that is broken into smaller time slots

# General message passing
Bridges enable the transfer of assets or tokens between different blockchain networks. General message passing allows users to initiate **actions** on one blockchain and have those **actions** relayed to another blockchain via the bridge

# Gateway
This is the dApp that allows users to interact with the Hyperbridge network. It is the interface that users interact with to bridge tokens across different networks.

# ISMP
The Interoperable State Machine Protocol (ISMP) is a protocol that enables the transfer of assets and information between different blockchain networks. It is designed to facilitate communication and interoperability between disparate blockchains.

# State witness

This is the current state or history of the blockchain before the state transition is executed. It contains all the storage items and merkle proofs for the items accessed by the transactions in the block.
