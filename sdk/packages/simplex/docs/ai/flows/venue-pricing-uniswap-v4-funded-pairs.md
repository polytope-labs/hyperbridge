# Venue pricing (Uniswap V4 funded pairs)

Verified 2026-08-19.

```
resolveLegRates(...)
  curveless pair && token0 is a USD stable
    -> venuePriceMemo() -> getVenueUsdPrice(chain, token1)
         -> UniswapV4FundingPlanner.getExoticTokenPrice
              picks the position with the largest pool liquidity
              -> computeDirectPoolPriceUsd -> sdkPool.token0Price / token1Price
    -> checkPriceGuard(...)   reject if outside maxDeviationBps of the static reference
    -> rate = 1 / venueUsd
  otherwise -> the pair's ask/bid curve at the leg's notional
```

`computeDirectPoolPriceUsd` returns the **raw pool mid** derived from `sqrtPriceX96`. The pool's
fee tier is read and stored on the hydrated position (`pos.fee`) but never applied to the price,
and there is no size or impact term — `computeLegPolicyOutput` extends the mid linearly across the
whole priced quantity. `checkPriceGuard` is the only defense on this path, and it checks deviation
from a static reference, not execution cost. A venue-priced pair that has to swap through its own
pool to source inventory pays a fee tier it never quoted against.
