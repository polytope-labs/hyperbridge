# Pallet ISMP

The `pallet-ismp` is the central module of the Hyperbridge blockchain. It is the core innovation that makes the Hyperbridge protocol possible. It is responsible for:

 - Verifying the consensus proofs and managing the state commitments of it's connected chains through the use of "consensus clients".
 - Verifying and aggregating the cross-chain messages that are relayed from its connected chains.
 - Managing various consensus clients on behalf of it's connected chains.

## State Commitments

The `pallet-ismp` module is responsible for tracking the state commitments of the connected chains. A state commitment is a cryptographic commitment to the state of a blockchain at a specific height. It is the output of consensus proof verification by a consensus client. The state commitment is used to verify the authenticity of cross-chain messages that need to be aggregated from connected chains.

## Cross-Chain Messages

The `pallet-ismp` module is also responsible for verifying the legitimacy of cross-chain messages between the connected chains. Cross-chain messages that are sent from one chain to another must first be verified and aggregated on the Hyperbridge blockchain. The Hyperbridge blockchain accumulates these messages into a [merkle mountain range tree](/protocol/cryptography/merkle-trees/mountain-range), this tree serves as a secondary state commitment scheme. It was chosen for its space-efficient membership proofs as opposed to the base-16 merkle patricia trie. Merkle mountain range proofs are used by relayers to authenticate the cross-chain messages that are to be delivered to a destination chain. In the future, messages will be accumulated into a more efficient [Verkle trie](/protocol/cryptography/verkle-tries).

## Consensus Clients

The Hyperbridge blockchain uses "consensus clients" to verify the consensus proofs of the connected chains. A consensus client is a module that is responsible for verifying the consensus proofs which attest to the finality of some state commitment of a specific blockchain. Any blockchain that produces consensus proofs can be connected to the Hyperbridge blockchain through a consensus client. The `pallet-ismp` module manages the consensus clients on behalf of the connected chains. The consensus clients currently supported by the Hyperbridge protocol are:

 - [Parachain Consensus Client](https://github.com/polytope-labs/hyperbridge/tree/main/modules/ismp/clients/parachain/client)
 - [Sync Committee Consensus Client](https://github.com/polytope-labs/hyperbridge/tree/main/modules/ismp/clients/sync-committee)
 - [Binance Smart Chain Consensus Client](https://github.com/polytope-labs/hyperbridge/blob/main/modules/ismp/clients/bsc/src/lib.rs)
