# Parachain Integration

## Ismp Parachain

This module allows a parachain to register the sibling parachains whose state commitments it needs to access.    
The parachain support is based on an inherent provider and inherent extrinsics. The inherent provider reads the ismp-parachain pallet for a list of supported parachain ids,  
it then reads the relay chain state and fetches a state proof of the latest headers for the supported parachains and submits a consensus message as an inherent extrinsic.  
This message will be verified by the `ParachainConsensusClient` included in the runtime.

## Pallet Config

The pallet has the followinf configuration

```rust
    #[pallet::config]
	pub trait Config:
		frame_system::Config + pallet_ismp::Config + cumulus_pallet_parachain_system::Config
	{
		/// The overarching event type
		type RuntimeEvent: From<Event<Self>> + IsType<<Self as frame_system::Config>::RuntimeEvent>;

		/// The underlying [`IsmpHost`] implementation
		type IsmpHost: IsmpHost + Default;
	}
```
## Inherent provider

The pallet implements `ProvideInherent` which is used to submit consensus update messages.  
The use of inherents to receive consensus messages for finalized parachain heads removes the need for an offchain consensus relayer to facilitate parachain to parachain communication.


## Pallet calls

* `update_parachain_consensus`
This is an inherent call that is used by the collator to include the consensus update message for the parachain consensus client.

* `add_parachain`
This call allows a priviledged origin to add a new parachain to the list of supported parachains. whenever a new parachain is added, the inherent provider will add state proofs of the parachain's latest header in subsequent consensus messages.  

* `remove_parachain`
This priviledged call removes a parachain from the list of supported parachains, thereby preventing any future state updates from such parachain.  

## LifeCycle

### OnInitialize

In the OnInitialize hook, the consensus state for the parachain consensus client will be initialized if it does not exist.


### OnFinalize

This hook is used to read the current relay chain state in order to get the state root of the finalized relay chain block, so it can be used to verify subsequent parachain consensus update messages.  


## ParachainConsensusClient

The parachain consensus client is an ISMP consensus client that verifies parachain consensus update messages. These messages contain membership proofs for whitelisted parachain headers in the finalized relaychain head.
The client uses the relaychain commitments stored in the pallet to verify these state proofs.


For a parachain that wants to connect to Hyperbridge, after including pallet-ismp in its runtime the next step is to include `ismp-parachain`.  
This pallet allows the parachain to receive consensus message updates for whitelisted parachains as through an inherent extrinsic.

# Adding the ismp-parachain to the runtime

To include the pallet in the runtime, implement the pallet config for the Runtime and add the pallet to the `construct_runtime` macro.

```rust
   impl ismp_parachain::Config for Runtime {
        type RuntimeEvent = RuntimeEvent;
        // pallet-ismp implements the IsmpHost
        type IsmpHost = Ismp;
   }

   parameter_types! {
        // The hyperbridge parachain on Polkadot
        pub const Coprocessor: Option<StateMachine> = Some(StateMachine::Polkadot(3367));
   }

   impl pallet_ismp::Config for Runtime {
        // ...
        type Coprocessor = Coprocessor;
        type ConsensusClients = (
            // Add the parachain consensus clients to the supported consensus clients when configuring pallet-ismp
            ismp_parachain::ParachainConsensusClient<Runtime, IsmpParachain>,
        );
        // ...
   }

   construct_runtime! {
    // ...
    Ismp: pallet_ismp,
    IsmpParachain: ismp_parachain
   }
```

The inherent provider requires a runtime api to read the pallet state

```rust
    impl ismp_parachain_runtime_api::IsmpParachainApi<Block> for Runtime {
		fn para_ids() -> Vec<u32> {
			IsmpParachain::para_ids()
		}

		fn current_relay_chain_state() -> RelayChainState {
			IsmpParachain::current_relay_chain_state()
		}
	}
```

## Adding the inherent provider to the node

The inherent provider needs to be added to the collator params as shown in the code below

```rust
fn start_consensus(
    client: Arc<FullClient>,
    backend: Arc<FullBackend>,
    block_import: ParachainBlockImport,
    prometheus_registry: Option<&Registry>,
    telemetry: Option<TelemetryHandle>,
    task_manager: &TaskManager,
    relay_chain_interface: Arc<dyn RelayChainInterface>,
    transaction_pool: Arc<sc_transaction_pool::FullPool<opaque::Block, FullClient>>,
    sync_oracle: Arc<SyncingService<opaque::Block>>,
    keystore: KeystorePtr,
    relay_chain_slot_duration: Duration,
    para_id: ParaId,
    collator_key: CollatorPair,
    overseer_handle: OverseerHandle,
    announce_block: Arc<dyn Fn(opaque::Hash, Option<Vec<u8>>) + Send + Sync>,
) {
    // .. omitted calls

    let (client_clone, relay_chain_interface_clone) =
        (client.clone(), relay_chain_interface.clone());
    let params = lookahead::Params {
        create_inherent_data_providers: move |parent, ()| {
            let client = client_clone.clone();
            let relay_chain_interface = relay_chain_interface_clone.clone();
            async move {
                let inherent = ismp_parachain_inherent::ConsensusInherentProvider::create(
                    parent,
                    client,
                    relay_chain_interface,
                ).await?;

                Ok(inherent)
            }
        },
        ..Default::default()
        // omitted fields
    };
    
    // ..omitted calls
}
```

## Connecting to Hyperbridge

Connecting to hyperbridge is simple, you only need to add Hyperbridge's parachain Id (`3367`) to the list of supported parachain ids in the pallet then the chain can start sending/receiving messages to/from hyperbridge.  
This can be done by calling `add_parachain` extrinsic from the admin origin specified in `pallet-ismp`.
