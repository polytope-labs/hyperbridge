# The Interoperable State Machine Protocol

The Interoperable State Machine Protocol (ISMP) is a lightweight, unopinionated messaging protocol designed to enable the development of cryptographically secure cross-chain applications. It employs the use of **consensus and state proofs to authorize cross-chain request execution**, providing a level of security equivalent to that of the underlying blockchains it connects.

ISMP is designed to be light weight with a very minimal API surface area. Its lightweight design means that ISMP is economically feasible even within expensive environments such as Ethereum. In addition, it offers a familiar and easy-to-understand message-passing mechanism that mimcs the already standard HTTP protocol.
