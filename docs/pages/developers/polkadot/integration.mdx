# Pallet ISMP

This is the implementation of ISMP for substrate chains. It is the foundational component that allows communication over ISMP. It correctly composes the various ISMP components in the runtime.


## Pallet Config 

The Pallet has the following Config trait

```rust
	#[pallet::config]
	pub trait Config: frame_system::Config {
		/// The overarching event type.
		type RuntimeEvent: From<Event<Self>> + IsType<<Self as frame_system::Config>::RuntimeEvent>;

		/// Admin origin for privileged actions such as adding new consensus clients as well as
		/// modifying existing consensus clients (eg. challenge period, unbonding period)
		type AdminOrigin: EnsureOrigin<Self::RuntimeOrigin>;

		/// Timestamp interface [`UnixTime`] for querying the current timestamp. This is used within
		/// the various ISMP sub-protocols.
		type TimestampProvider: UnixTime;

		/// The balance of an account.
		type Balance: Parameter
			+ Member
			+ AtLeast32BitUnsigned
			+ Codec
			+ Default
			+ Copy
			+ MaybeSerializeDeserialize
			+ Debug
			+ MaxEncodedLen
			+ TypeInfo
			+ FixedPointOperand;

		/// The currency that is offered to relayers as payment for request delivery
		/// and execution. This should ideally be a stablecoin of some kind to guarantee
		/// predictable and stable revenue for relayers.
		///
		/// This can also be used with pallet-assets through the
		/// [ItemOf](frame_support::traits::tokens::fungible::ItemOf) implementation
		type Currency: Mutate<Self::AccountId, Balance = Self::Balance>;

		/// The state machine identifier for the host chain. This is the identifier that will be
		/// used to accept requests that are addressed to this state machine. Remote chains
		/// will also use this identifier to accept requests originating from this state
		/// machine.
		type HostStateMachine: Get<StateMachine>;

		/// The coprocessor is a state machine which proxies requests on our behalf. The coprocessor
		/// does this by performing the costly consensus and state proof verification needed to
		/// verify requests/responses that are addressed to this host state machine.
		///
		/// The ISMP framework permits the coprocessor to aggregate messages from potentially
		/// multiple state machines. Finally producing much cheaper proofs of consensus and state
		/// needed to verify the legitimacy of the messages.
		type Coprocessor: Get<Option<StateMachine>>;

		/// [`IsmpRouter`] implementation for routing requests & responses to their appropriate
		/// modules.
		type Router: IsmpRouter + Default;

		/// This should provide a list of [`ConsenusClient`](ismp::consensus::ConsensusClient)s
		/// which should be used to validate incoming requests or responses. There should be
		/// at least one consensus client present to allow messages be processed by the ISMP
		/// subsystems.
		type ConsensusClients: ConsensusClientProvider;

		/// This implementation should provide the weight consumed by `IsmpModule` callbacks from
		/// their benchmarks.
		type WeightProvider: WeightProvider;

		/// Merkle mountain range overlay tree implementation. Outgoing requests and responses are
		/// inserted in this "overlay tree" to enable cheap proofs for messages.
		///
		/// State machines that do not need this can simply use the `NoOpMmrTree`
		type Mmr: MerkleMountainRangeTree<Leaf = Leaf>;
	}
```

## State commitments

Pallet Ismp is responsible for storing the commitments for requests and responses. It uses both a child trie and optionally a merkle mountain range tree.  
Commitments for requests and responses are always stored in a child trie instead of the global state trie, this provides smaller sized proofs further improving the cost of verification.  
To further drive down costs of verifications, Hyperbridge commits requests and responses to a merkle mountain range tree, merkle mountain range trees provide smaller sized proofs and cheaper verification on the EVM
this allows us to drive gas costs down for users sending messages to EVM chains. 

## Offchain Storage

While commitments are stored onchain for verifiability, the requests and responses are stored in the offchain database, this allows us to minimize the  runtime storage size and allows pruning of delivered requests and responses.
This would help maintain reasonable storage requirements for full nodes as the network grows.

### Offchain Canonicalizing Gadget

The offchain DB is not fork-aware, this means it can be corrupted by chain reorgs, this can break the MMR and prevent correct proof generation. To prevent this we run a background task that canonicalizes the offchain database whenever the relaychain finalizes the parachain block.
This means that generating MMR proofs is only available after finalization.  

## Implementations

`IsmpHost`: Pallet Ismp implements `IsmpHost` providing all the storage requirements for ISMP.  
`IsmpDispatcher`: It implements `IsmpDispatcher` allowing it to dispatch requests and responses.  


## Pallet Ismp calls

* `create_consensus_client`  
This is a priviledged call used to initialize the consensus state of a consensus client. Consensus clients must to be initialized with a trusted state, so this call must only be called by a trusted party.

* `update_consensus_state`
This is a priviledged call used to update the unbonding period or challenge_period for a consensus client. It must only be called by a trusted parties to prevent consensus exploits.

* `handle_unsigned`
Execute the provided batch of ISMP messages, this will short-circuit and revert if any of the provided messages are invalid. This is an unsigned extrinsic that permits anyone  
execute ISMP messages for free, provided they have valid proofs and the messages havenot been previously processed.  
		
The dispatch origin for this call must be an unsigned one.  
		
Emits different message events based on the Message received if successful.  

Only available when the pallet is built with the `unsigned` feature flag.  

* `handle`
Execute the provided batch of ISMP messages. This call will short-circuit and revert if any of the provided messages are invalid.  
		
The dispatch origin for this call must be a signed one.  
	
Emits different message events based on the Message received if successful.  

Only available when the `unsigned` feature flag is disabled.  

* `fund_message`
During periods of high transaction fees on the destination chain, you can increase the relayer fee for in-flight requests and responses to incentivize their delivery.  
Simply call this function with the request/response commitment and the desired fee increase amount.  

Should not be called on a message that has been completed (delivered or timed-out) as those funds will be lost forever.  

## Transaction fees

Hyperbridge does not charge transaction fees for delivering valid ISMP messages to the chain.  
Protocol fees are collected on the source chain for a message, this ensures that every message that gets delivered to the hyperbridge chain has to be paid for before valid proofs can exist.  
Malformed messages or messages with invalid proofs cannot not make it into the transaction pool of a Hyperbridge node.

## Including Pallet Ismp in the runtime
Including `pallet-ismp` in a substrate runtime requires implementing the pallet config.  

```rust
    parameter_types! {
        // The hyperbridge parachain on Polkadot
        pub const Coprocessor: Option<StateMachine> = Some(StateMachine::Polkadot(3367));
        // The host state machine of this pallet
        pub const HostStateMachine: StateMachine = StateMachine::Polkadot(1000); // your paraId here
    }

    impl pallet_ismp::Config for Runtime {
        // configure the runtime event
        type RuntimeEvent = RuntimeEvent;
        // Permissioned origin who can create or update consensus clients
        type AdminOrigin = EnsureRoot<AccountId>;
        // The state machine identifier for this state machine
        type HostStateMachine = HostStateMachine;
        // The pallet_timestamp pallet
        type TimestampProvider = Timestamp;
        // The currency implementation that is offered to relayers
        type Currency = Balances;
        // The balance type for the currency implementation
        type Balance = Balance;
        // Router implementation for routing requests/responses to their respective modules
        type Router = Router;
        // Optional coprocessor for incoming requests/responses
        type Coprocessor = Coprocessor;
        // Supported consensus clients
        type ConsensusClients = (
            // as an example, the parachain consensus client
            ismp_parachain::ParachainConsensusClient<Runtime, IsmpParachain>,
        );
        // Optional merkle mountain range overlay tree, for cheaper outgoing request proofs.
        // You most likely don't need it, just use the `NoOpMmrTree`
        type Mmr = NoOpMmrTree<Runtime>;
        // Weight provider for local modules
        type WeightProvider = ();
    }

    construct_runtime! {
        // ...
        Ismp: pallet_ismp
    }
```

### Config components
Let's go through some of the ISMP specific components of the configuration.  

* `HostStateMachine`
This is the state machine identifier for your chain, it will be used as the `source value for all requests that are dispatched from this chain.  
For parachains, this should be your parachain id e.g `StateMachine::Polkadot(1000)`.    
* `Coprocessor`
ISMP is built around the idea of a coprocessor that aggregates consensus and state proofs from multiple state machines into a more succinct proof that is cheaply verifiable.  
This component defines the state machine identifier of the supported coprocessor, Hyperbridge is a coprocessor for ISMP.  
* `ConsensusClients` 
This is a tuple of types that implement the `ConsensusClient` interface, it defines all the consensus algorithms supported by this deployment of the protocol.  
* `Mmr`
 This type allows us to use mmr tree as an overlay for cheaper proofs for requests and responses instead of the merkle patricia trie proofs.  

* `Router` 
The router is a type that provides an `IsmpModule` implementation for a module id.  

```rust
#[derive(Default)]
struct Router;

impl IsmpRouter for Router {
    fn module_for_id(&self, id: Vec<u8>) -> Result<Box<dyn IsmpModule>, Error> {
        let module = match id.as_slice() {
           YOUR_MODULE_ID => Box::new(YourModule::default()),
           // ... other modules
            _ => Err(Error::ModuleNotFound(id))?
        };
        Ok(module)
    }
}

/// Some custom module capable of processing some incoming/request or response.
/// This could also be a pallet itself.
#[derive(Default)]
struct YourModule;

impl IsmpModule for YourModule {
    /// Called by the ISMP hanlder, to notify module of a new POST request
    /// the module may choose to respond immediately, or in a later block
    fn on_accept(&self, request: Post) -> Result<(), Error> {
        // do something useful with the request
        Ok(())
    }

    /// Called by the ISMP hanlder, to notify module of a response to a previously
    /// sent out request
    fn on_response(&self, response: Response) -> Result<(), Error> {
         // do something useful with the response
         Ok(())
    }

     /// Called by the ISMP hanlder, to notify module of requests that were previously
     /// sent but have now timed-out
 	fn on_timeout(&self, request: Timeout) -> Result<(), Error> {
        // revert any state changes that were made prior to dispatching the request
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

`WeightProvider`: This type allows providing the static benchmarks for all ismp modules, it should identify modules by their id and return the weights for each `IsmpModule` callback

```rust
   struct YourModuleBenchmarks;
   impl pallet_ismp::weights::IsmpModuleWeight for YourModuleBenchmarks {
        /// Should return the weight used in processing this request
	    fn on_accept(&self, request: &Post) -> Weight {
            todo!("Return benchmark weight")
        }
	    /// Should return the weight used in processing this timeout
	    fn on_timeout(&self, request: &Timeout) -> Weight {
            todo!("Return benchmark weight")
        }
	    /// Should return the weight used in processing this response
	    fn on_response(&self, response: &Response) -> Weight {
            todo!("Return benchmark weight")
        }
   }

   struct ModuleWeightProvider
   impl pallet_ismp::WeightProvider for ModuleWeightProvider {
	fn module_callback(dest_module: ModuleId) -> Option<Box<dyn IsmpModuleWeight>> {
		match dest_module.to_bytes().as_slice() {
            YOUR_MODULE_ID => {
                Some(Box::new(YourModuleBenchmarks::default()))
            }
            // ... other modules
            _ => None
        }
	}
}
```

## Runtime api

pallet-ismp-runtime-api provides methods that allow the rpc client read the runtime state, this methods include querying requests and responses, generating proofs, among others.
The runtime api can be easily added to the runtime as follows:

```rust 
impl pallet_ismp_runtime_api::IsmpRuntimeApi<Block, <Block as BlockT>::Hash> for Runtime {
		fn host_state_machine() -> StateMachine {
			<Runtime as pallet_ismp::Config>::HostStateMachine::get()
		}

		fn challenge_period(consensus_state_id: [u8; 4]) -> Option<u64> {
			Ismp::challenge_period(consensus_state_id)
		}

		/// Generate a proof for the provided leaf indices
		fn generate_proof(
			keys: ProofKeys
		) -> Result<(Vec<Leaf>, Proof<<Block as BlockT>::Hash>), sp_mmr_primitives::Error> {
			Ismp::generate_proof(keys)
		}

		/// Fetch all ISMP events in the block, should only be called from runtime-api.
		fn block_events() -> Vec<::ismp::events::Event> {
			Ismp::block_events()
		}

		/// Fetch all ISMP events and their extrinsic metadata, should only be called from runtime-api.
		fn block_events_with_metadata() -> Vec<(::ismp::events::Event, u32)> {
			Ismp::block_events_with_metadata()
		}

		/// Return the scale encoded consensus state
		fn consensus_state(id: ConsensusClientId) -> Option<Vec<u8>> {
			Ismp::consensus_states(id)
		}

		/// Return the timestamp this client was last updated in seconds
		fn consensus_update_time(id: ConsensusClientId) -> Option<u64> {
			Ismp::consensus_update_time(id)
		}

		/// Return the latest height of the state machine
		fn latest_state_machine_height(id: StateMachineId) -> Option<u64> {
			Ismp::latest_state_machine_height(id)
		}


		/// Get actual requests
		fn requests(commitments: Vec<H256>) -> Vec<Request> {
			Ismp::requests(commitments)
		}

		/// Get actual requests
		fn responses(commitments: Vec<H256>) -> Vec<Response> {
			Ismp::responses(commitments)
		}
	}
```

While ISMP can be used independently, connecting to hyperbridge provides access to all its connected chains. In the next sections we'll look into how you can integrate with hyperbridge as a parachain or solochain.
