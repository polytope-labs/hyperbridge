# Hyperbridge

> Hyperbridge is a hyper-scalable coprocessor for verifiable, cross-chain interoperability.


## Join the network.

Hyperbridge is the first fully permissionless and decentralized cross-chain protocol powered by interoperability proofs.
It allows **anyone** to run a relayer which transmits messages across chains without any staking or whitelisting. [Learn more about relayers.](https://docs.hyperbridge.network/developers/explore/relayers)

## Developers

Onchain application developers can leverage Hyperbridge for mission-critical cross-chain applications which do not have the luxury of centralized or trusted security models.
