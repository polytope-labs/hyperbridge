# 2026-08-24 — The 30bps pool haircut keys off the declaration, and lands on price only

Chosen: in `aggregatePhantomBids`, haircut a bid's quoted leg amounts by 30bps when its paymasterAndData declaration names Uniswap V4 positions.

Alternatives considered:

- **Keying off the positions that pass the ownership check** (the `positions` array, not `declaration.uniswapV4Positions`). Rejected: those are filtered by owner and skipped entirely when the chain has no `positionManager`/`stateView` configured, so the same bid would be priced two different ways depending on indexer config. The declaration is what the solver signed, and it is what says "this quote came off a pool".
- **Haircutting the weight instead of the price.** Rejected: the weight is deliverable inventory, read on-chain, and it is also what the liquidity sweep reports — discounting it would make a provider's reported inventory and the depth attributed to it disagree, which the sweep exists to prevent. The fee is a cost of the trade, not a reduction in the size held.
- **Applying it after the median, to the leg's published price.** Rejected: the median is liquidity-weighted across bids, so haircutting the aggregate would also discount wallet-funded quotes that never pay a pool fee, and it would change which quote wins the median only by accident. The haircut belongs on the individual quote, before it competes.
- **Making the rate configurable per chain or pool.** Deferred: the positions these bids declare sit in 30bps-tier pools, and a knob invites the number to drift out of sync between the indexer and simplex. A single exported constant is easy to widen into a lookup if a different tier ever shows up.

Why 30bps at all: without it, a pool-priced bid reads richer than a wallet-funded one on a fee it has not yet paid, so it wins the median and the published price is one nobody can actually execute at.

A consequence worth knowing: a leg amount small enough that the haircut rounds it to zero now takes the "solver declined this leg" path. That is the correct reading — a quote that rounds away is not a price — and it only bites at dust amounts.
