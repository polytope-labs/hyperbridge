# Overview

The `@hyperbridge/sdk` is a comprehensive JavaScript/TypeScript SDK that provides utilities for interacting with the Hyperbridge indexer, monitoring cross-chain message statuses, and managing chain interactions. It supports both EVM and Substrate chains, offering a unified interface for tracking POST and GET requests across different blockchain networks.

## Installation

Install the SDK using your preferred package manager:

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'yarn', 'npm']}>
<Tab value="npm">
```bash
npm install @hyperbridge/sdk
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="yarn">
```bash
yarn add @hyperbridge/sdk
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="pnpm">
```bash
pnpm add @hyperbridge/sdk
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Overview

The SDK consists of several key components that work together to provide a seamless cross-chain development experience:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **IndexerClient** | Main client for querying the Hyperbridge indexer and monitoring request statuses |
| **IChain Interface** | Unified interface for interacting with different chain types (EVM/Substrate) |
| **EvmChain** | Implementation for EVM-compatible chains |
| **SubstrateChain** | Implementation for Substrate-based chains |
| **TokenGateway** | Utilities for cross-chain token transfers and fee estimation |
