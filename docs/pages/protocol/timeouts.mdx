# Timeouts

Blockchains may become incapable of processing transactions due to various reasons. These might include *liveness failures*, which can occur when the state transition function becomes unable to produce new blocks, transaction fee spikes that make transaction execution unprofitable, or a doomsday scenario such as a nation state sanctioned attack.

Regardless of the reason, if the destination chain cannot process incoming ISMP requests, the framework provides a timeout mechanism. This feature allows for the safe reversion of state changes that were executed prior to dispatching the request, as if no issue ever occurred.

In the context of the ISMP framework, POST requests, POST responses, and GET requests have the ability to time out due to the `timeout_timestamp` value they possess. This value stipulates the lifespan of a message and is evaluated from the perspective of the sending chain.
