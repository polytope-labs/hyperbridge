# Typescript Developers

The `@hyperbridge/sdk` is a comprehensive TypeScript SDK that provides utilities for interacting with the Hyperbridge indexer, monitoring cross-chain message statuses, and managing chain interactions. It supports both EVM and Substrate chains, offering a unified interface for tracking POST and GET requests across different blockchain networks.

## Overview

The SDK consists of several key components that work together to provide a seamless cross-chain development experience:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **IndexerClient** | Main client for querying the Hyperbridge indexer and monitoring request statuses |
| **EvmChain** | Implementation for EVM-compatible chains |
| **SubstrateChain** | Implementation for Substrate-based chains |

## What You'll Learn

This documentation covers everything you need to build cross-chain applications with the Hyperbridge SDK:

- **[Getting Started](/developers/sdk/getting-started)** - Initialize the SDK and create your first cross-chain connection
- **[Vite Integration](/developers/sdk/vite-integration)** - Set up the SDK with Vite projects
- **[Tracking Requests](/developers/sdk/tracking/post-requests)** - Track POST and GET requests throughout their lifecycle
