# Responses

A `PostResponse` can be seen as the result or return value of a `PostRequest` execution. `IsmpModule`s may choose not to emit `PostResponse` and instead employ an optimistic model where state is modified in a way that can be reverted when the request times out. This saves significant message round trip and verification costs and provides a better experience for application users.

## Handlers



### `handle_response`


:::danger
It's important to note that if the `IsmpModule::on_response` does not return `Ok`, the receipt of this response will not be persisted, allowing the response to be **replayed**. Consequently, the `IsmpModule` is responsible for maintaining all invariants before modifying it's internal state to prevent partial state changes that could result in critical vulnerabilities in their response handler. This model ensures that if a response cannot be executed successfully on a destination state machine, it can time out gracefully on the source.
