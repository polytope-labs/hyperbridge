Critical to the function of Hyperbridge are the relayers who transmit requests & responses across it's connected chains. Unlike popular interoperability protocols, Hyperbridge relayers are fully permissionless. This means, relayers will not need to be staked or whitelisted in order to transmit cross-chain messages. This is as a result of it's first-of-it's kind, fully trust-free design. This service of-course, will not be for free. Hyperbridge permits the applications that leverage it’s secure message passing infrastructure to pay ahead of time for the message delivery & execution. They do so on the source chain of the initiating application.

<br />
Fees for cross-chain requests are to be paid in stable coins, We’ve chosen the DAI
stablecoin for it’s decentralized and censorship-resistant properties. This means
users will estimate the cost for message execution & provide what they believe to
be a fair amount in DAI to the Hyperbridge contract. (Specifically, the [EvmHost](https://github.com/polytope-labs/hyperbridge/blob/main/evm/src/hosts/EvmHost.sol#L533))
at the time of dispatching a request. Once the request has been finalized by the
originating chain and these finality proofs made available to the destination chain.
The request becomes eligible for delivery & execution. A relayer will estimate the
cost of request delivery and query the fee that has been put up for it’s delivery
on the source chain. Depending on their profitability configuration, they’ll either
choose to deliver the request or ignore it.
<br />
If the relayers chooses to deliver the request, then this means they will cover the
cost of message delivery and execution. This cost of message delivery is the cost
of proof verification of requests & responses. The cost of message execution is the
cost of executing the message on the destination module. In the current version of
the protocol, relayers are tasked with both delivering and executing the messages.
But it is entirely possible in future versions of the protocol that we unbundle message
delivery and execution as this may enable more exotic applications.
<br />
In our chosen design, relayers race to deliver a batch of cross-chain messages to
their respective destination chains. This has a few benefits, this effectively mitigates
any liveness issues that may arise as a result of some whitelisted relayers going
down. This free market design presents a much better UX to end users and applications.
The winning relayer, can be decided by a few factors.
<br />

1. Block notification.

Relayer are mostly idle, and will only check for new messages to be delivered when the chains they’re interested in receive new consensus messages. The consensus messages, contain proofs that finalizes a new set of block heights. The new block heights, may or may not contain new messages to be delivered from the hyperbridge parachain. Therefore, whichever relayer sees the block where these consensus messages were processed on the destination chain first, can begin the check before everyone else and as a result, deliver the new batch of requests before anyone else.

2. Query throughput

We can for the purposes of this criteria assume that every single relayer has received the block notification at the same time. Now they have to do a few things, first they’ll query for the new requests available, next they’ll need to query the fees associated with these requests, and finally query the cost of executing these requests by simulating them individually as a transaction on the full node for it’s destination chain.

If the relayer is able to query high-performance nodes and has a very fast internet connection, or even better is colocated the nodes in question. You can already see how this provides an edge in being the first to deliver the requests.

3. MEV

An unfortunate development in blockchain protocols are validators who auction their blockspace. They do so in order to earn even more money than the underlying protocols already pay them. It’s not impossible that relayers may integrate with validators who auction their blockspace using proposer-builder networks in order to have their bundles always be first in the block. Of-course these relayers would have to pay high priority fees for such shenanigans. But we fully expect relayer competition to eventually reach these levels.

<br />

Once a relayer successfully delivers a batch of requests, they can immediately start claiming the associated fees for these requests. They’ll do so by submitting state proofs of the messages delivered on the destination chain to hyperbridge. Once hyperbridge verifies these proofs, it will make the fees available to the relayer by issuing a request to it’s contracts on the source chain. The relayer will be responsible for delivering this request as it will have no fee attached and will hence be ignored by other relayers.

## Installation

The hyperbridge node will now be available at `target/release/tesseract`, You can move the binary to your `$PATH` so you can run it directly.

<br />
Update your path to include `${HOME}/.local/bin`. If you are using Bash, run the following. Alternatively, replace `${HOME}/.bashrc` with `${HOME}/.zshrc` if using Zsh. Replace `source` with `.` if necessary.

```bash
# add .local/bin to path if it doesn't exist
export RC_PATH=${HOME}/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="${HOME}/.local/bin:${PATH}"' >> ${RC_PATH}
source ${RC_PATH}

# create dir if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p $HOME/.local/bin/
mv target/release/tesseract $HOME/.local/bin/
```

::::

## Running the relayer

The tesseract relayer command line interface expects two arguments, which are the paths to it's configuration file and database file. Because it resides in a docker container, you will need to [map the directory](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/#start-a-container-with-a-bind-mount) where you've stored the configuration files on your host into the docker container. Tesseract will write it's database to that directory once it's initialized.

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name=tesseract \
  --network=host \
  --restart=always \
  --volume=/dir/on/host:/home/root \
  polytopelabs/tesseract:latest \
  --config=/home/root/config.toml \
  --db=/home/root/dev.db
```

Access it's logs using

```bash
docker logs -f tesseract
```

### System Requirements

At the minimum, the hyperbridge relayer should be run on a machine with at least 4GB of RAM and a quad-core cpu. This relayer should also have at least a 100Mb/s connection if it is to query nodes over the internet.

### Ansible Playbooks

A community member has graciously provided their ansible playbook for running the hyperbridge relayer. You can find it here:

 - [schmiatz/hyperbridge-relayer](https://github.com/schmiatz/hyperbridge-relayer)

## Configuration

The configuration file is a toml file that at the moment, that expects the following configuration options:

```toml
# Hyperbridge config, required
[hyperbridge]
state_machine = { Kusama = 4009 }
# Hyperbridge node ws rpc endpoint.
rpc_ws = "ws://127.0.0.1:9944" # example endpoint
# Sets the maximum size of an rpc request or response in bytes defaults to 150mb
max_rpc_payload_size = 150000000

# Relayer config, required
[relayer]
# Define your profitability configuration. 0 -> 0% i.e relay all requests, even unprofitable ones. 1 -> 1%. ie fees provided for requests must be profitable by at least 1%. etc.
minimum_profit_percentage = 0
# (Optional) If not empty, will filter requests to be delivered by originating module identifier (eg contract address/pallet ids)
module_filter = []
# How frequently to initiate withdrawals in seconds, defaults to 24 hours
withdrawal_frequency = 86400
# Minimum amount to withdraw when auto-withdrawing, defaults to $100
minimum_withdrawal_amount = 100
# (Optional) If not empty, tesseract will only deliver requests to the specified state-machines
delivery_endpoints = [
    { Ethereum = "ExecutionLayer" },
    { Ethereum = "Arbitrum" },
    { Ethereum = "Optimism" },
    { Ethereum = "Base" },
    "Bsc"
]

# Here you'll declare a new chain entry for every chain you want to support.
# eg ethereum
[ethereum]
# configuration type can be either "evm" or "substrate"
type = "evm"
# State machine identifier for the this evm chain. The possible values:
# state_machine = { Ethereum = "ExecutionLayer" } # Ethereum L1
# state_machine = { Ethereum = "Arbitrum" }
# state_machine = { Ethereum = "Optimism" }
# state_machine = { Ethereum = "Base" }
# state_machine = "Bsc" # Binance smart chain
state_machine = { Ethereum = "ExecutionLayer" }
# http(s) rpc urls for evm based chains
# Multiple rpc endpoints supported for increased reliability
rpc_urls = ["http://127.0.0.1:8545", ""]
# The consensus state identifier for this chain on hyperbridge.
# For Ethereum and it's L2s this will be "ETH0", for BSC this will be "BSC0".
consensus_state_id = "ETH0"
# Etherscan api key for querying the state machine's native token price.
# Do not that ethereum and all it's L2's use ETH as the native token
# So they can all share the same key gotten from etherscan.
#
# Bsc on the other hand uses the BNB token and would need its own API key
# gotten from bscscan
etherscan_api_key = ""
# The Handler contract address on this chain
handler = ""
# The IsmpHost contract address on this chain
ismp_host = ""
# (Optional)
# Maximum block range that should be used to query eth_getLogs in a single rpc call
# if this parameter is not supplied the range will not be split into smaller chunks
# and will be queried at once. This might be needed if you encounter rate limits
# from your rpc provider.
query_batch_size = 1000
# hex-encoded private key for the relayer account on this chain
signer = ""
# (Optional)
# Maximum number of concurrent rpc requests that can be used when tracing. If not supplied
# will trace entire transaction batches at once. This increases tracing speeds by performing
# tracing operations concurrently
#
# Note: Your rpc provider must support handling a large number of requests/sec(> 200 requests / sec) in parallel.
# Note: if you use the same provider for all your endpoints then a very high request/sec threshhold is required (> 1000 / sec)
tracing_batch_size = 5 # 5 transactions would be traced concurrently on this client
# (Optional)
# Buffer to add to gas price as a percentage of the current gas price
# to increase likelihood of the transactions going through e.g 1%, 2%
gas_price_buffer = 1

[substrate]
type = "substrate"
# The state machine identifier for this substrate based chain.
# must be one of:
# - { Polkadot = paraId }
# - { Kusama = paraId }
state_machine = { Kusama = 4009 }
# substrate node ws(s) rpc endpoint.
rpc_ws = "ws://127.0.0.1:9944" # example endpoint
# Configures the maximum size of an rpc request/response in bytes
max_rpc_payload_size = 150000000 # 150MB
# The consensus state identifier for this chain on hyperbridge.
# Only parachains are supported for now
consensus_state_id = "PARA"
# hex-encoded private key for the relayer account on this chain
signer = ""
```

It is optional to provide the configuration option for any of the connected chains, The only consequence is your relayer will not deliver requests from the ommitted chain as it has no way of querying the associated fees for requests originating from this chain.

You can obtain the required etherscan API key by following [this guide](https://docs.etherscan.io/getting-started/viewing-api-usage-statistics) for the appropriate network. Do note that since Ethereum and it's L2s all use Ether as the gas token. They can all share the same etherscan API key.

### Contract addresses

You can find the up-to-date contract addresses for the `Handler` & `IsmpHost` contracts [here](/developers/evm/integration#gargantua-v2)

## Withdrawing Fees

Tesseract maintains a local sqlite database where it keeps track of successfully delivered messages. The withdrawal process happens in two phases, the first phase is the fee accumulation on hyperbridge, then withdrawal on any of the connected chains.
In the fee accumulation phase, tesseract submits state proofs of messages all delivered to hyperbridge. If the proof verification is successful, the total amount of unclaimed fees for the relayer address is updated onchain. Next, the relayer can submit a withdrawal transaction to hyperbridge. This initiates potentially multiple ISMP requests to any chain where it has unclaimed fees, that instructs the Hyperbridge contract to credit the relayer their owed funds. This request will not timeout, allowing it to be submitted to the destination chain at any time.

### Accumulating fees

Stop any running relayer instances, run the following command in the terminal and wait for it to complete. The command will submit proofs for messages delivered to all chains present in the config file.

```bash
    docker run --network=host -v /dir/on/host:/home/root polytopelabs/tesseract:latest --config=/home/root/config.toml --db=/home/root/dev.db accumulate-fees
```

When accumulating fees the required state machine update to verify the proofs might not yet be available on hyperbridge, by default accumulating fees for those state machines will be skipped. To wait for all state machine updates.

```bash
    docker run --network=host -v /dir/on/host:/home/root polytopelabs/tesseract:latest --config=/home/root/config.toml --db=/home/root/dev.db accumulate-fees --wait
```

### Initiating withdrawals

To initiate a withdrawal from hyperbridge, a relayer needs to submit a transaction to hyperbridge with triggers the withdrawal request. This extrinsic is unsigned and will not require any native tokens for execution fees.Once the extrinsic is executed, hyperbridge dispatches a POST request that when executed on it's destination, will provide the relayer with the fees they've accrued. The relayer account must have sufficient funds to deliver this request to it's destination chain.

<br />
To use this feature run the following command:

```bash
    docker run --network=host -v /dir/on/host:/home/root polytopelabs/tesseract:latest --config=/home/root/config.toml --db=/home/root/dev.db accumulate-fees --withdraw
```

### Automatic accumulation and withdrawals

The relayer also runs background tasks for automatic fee accumulation and withdrawals. Whenever a batch of messages is successfully delivered, the fee accumulation task receives the delivery receipts and starts the process of accumulating the fees on hyperbridge. This process happens concurrently for all successfully delivered message batches. For redundancy, the delivery receipts are stored in the database prior to accumulation so they can be retried manually if any error is encountered.

<br />
Withdrawing fees from hyperbridge is triggered at fixed intervals based on the configured
`withdrawal_frequency` and `minimum_withdrawal_amount`. Feel free to the adjust these
values as desired. The task will only make a withdrawal attempt if your balance on
hyperbridge is greater than or equal to the configured `minimum_withdrawal_amount`.
Any failed withdrawal attempts will be retried each time the withdrawal task is triggered.
The manual processes described in the previous sections can be used as fallbacks
when errors are encountered by their automated conterparts.
