# Fees

Hyperbridge charges a non-refundable protocol fee per byte of the request/response body. This fee is withdrawn from the contract account calling the `IDispatcher`. Fees can be paid in either the native token, or the `IDispatcher`'s configured `feeToken`. Modules may also opt to pay a delivery fee for their messages to incentivize 3rd party relayers to deliver and execute their requests on the destination chain.


## Native Token Payments


The `IDispatcher` contract can be called with some `msg.value` to be used to pay for both the Hyperbridge protocol fees and relayer fees. Lets understand how this value is calculated. First we must understand that Hyperbridge ultimately collects it's fees in stablecoins. The configured stablecoin for fees is accessible by: 

```solidity showLineNumbers
address feeToken = IDispatcher(host()).feeToken();
```

So when you use the native token to pay for fees, The `IDispatcher` actually swaps this native token for the `feeToken` using UniswapV2 underneath.
So to quote the amount that's required for fees, you will need to call the following methods **offchain**:

```solidity showLineNumbers
uint256 perByteFee = IDispatcher(host()).perByteFee(request.dest);
uint256 protocolFees = request.body.length * perByteFee;
uint256 fees = protocolFees + request.fee;
address[] memory path = new address[](2);
path[0] = IUniswapV2Router02(_uniswap).WETH();
path[1] = address(IDispatcher(host()).feeToken());
uint256 nativeCost = IUniswapV2Router02(_uniswap).getAmountsIn(fees, path)[0];
```

Alternatively If your module extends the `BaseIsmpModule`, then you already have access to a convenient method `quoteNative` for this.

```solidity showLineNumbers
uint256 nativeCost = YourModule(moduleAddress).quoteNative(request);
```

Now you can simply dispatch the request while paying with the native token

```solidity showLineNumbers
IDispatcher(host()).dispatch{value: nativeCost}(request);
```

:::danger[Please Note]
It would be prudent to add at least 0.5% slippage to this quoted amount to prevent failed transactions.

## Stable Coin Payments

Alternatively, you might want to make payments directly in the configured `feeToken`. This would save on a considerable amount of gas, and as a result save your application users some money. To do this, ensure that your application has approved the host contract to spend infinitely, not to worry here. The host contract is immutable, ie not upgradeable, so you don't have to worry about getting drained.

In your contract constructor you should execute the following:

```solidity showLineNumbers
constructor() {
    // approve the host infintely
    address feeToken = IDispatcher(host()).feeToken();
    IERC20(feeToken).approve(host(), type(uint256).max);
}
```

Now that your contract has approved the `host`. You can now call dispatch without the `msg.value`. The host will withdraw the exact amount for it's protocol fees and any relayer fees from your contract's balance in the `feeToken`.

You can estimate the cost of a request through

```solidity showLineNumbers
uint256 perByteFee = IDispatcher(host()).perByteFee(request.dest);
uint256 protocolFees = request.body.length * perByteFee;
uint256 fees = protocolFees + request.fee;
```

Alternatively If your module extends the `BaseIsmpModule`, then a convenient method `quote` is provided for this.

```solidity showLineNumbers
uint256 feeTokenCost = YourModule(moduleAddress).quote(request);
```

Now you can simply dispatch the request without the `msg.value`. If this request is the side-effect of a user transaction, then you should withdraw the `feeToken` from the user's account before dispatching.

```solidity showLineNumbers
using SafeERC20 for IERC20;

address feeToken = IDispatcher(host()).feeToken();
IERC20(feeToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), feeTokenCost);
IDispatcher(host()).dispatch(request);
```

## Testnet Fees

The IsmpHost on testnet is not configured to accept dispatch fees in the native token. This is because it would require creating a uniswap pool with it's native token and `feeToken`. Therefore only `feeToken` payments are accepted on testnet. To get the `feeToken` for dispatch payments you can call the `tokenFaucet` like so:

```solidity
TokenFaucet(faucetAddress).drip(feeTokenAddress);
```

This will drip 1,000 feeTokens to the caller. This method can only be called once a day. Now you can dispatch using the "stable coin" payment method.


## Relayer Fees

The relayer fee is an optional incentive provided by applications initiating cross-chain transactions. It compensates Hyperbridge's decentralized relayers for delivering messages to the destination chain.

### Components

The fee consists of three parts:

 - **Proof verification cost**: For a cross-chain message to be delivered and executed, it must first be authenticated through state proofs. The expected cost for state proof verification is 150k gas. Contracts should account for this cost when setting the relayer fee.

 - **Message execution gas cost**:
    After proof verification, the receiving module is handed the request to be executed. This will consume some gas which should also be accounted for

 - **Relayer service fee**:
    This additional amount rewards relayers for their services. Relayers are profit-Driven mediators and they will prioritize messages with fees that ensure profitability.

Calculating the relayer fee can be expressed as follows:

```
destination_gas_cost = 150_000 + receiving_module_gas_cost
relayer_fee = gas_price_to_usd(destination_gas_price * destination_gas_cost) + relayer_tip_usd
```


### Mitigating Gas Cost Spikes

During periods of high gas prices on the destination chain, you can increase the relayer fee for in-flight requests and responses to incentivize their delivery.
The `IDispatcher` interface provides the `fundRequest` and `fundResponse` methods for this purpose. Simply call the appropriate function with the request/response commitment and the desired fee increase amount.
