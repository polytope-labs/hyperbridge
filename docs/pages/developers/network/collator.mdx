# Becoming a Collator

This guide outlines the complete process of leveraging a Relayer's hardwork and accrued revenue to become a Collator on the network.
Our system is designed to reward active and reliable participants by allowing them to use their earnings as a reputation score, which is the primary factor in Collator
selection. By becoming a Collator, a Relayer plays a more direct role in the network's liveness guarantees and block production.

## Who is a Collator
Collators are Block producers for the Hyperbridge Blockchain. Collators are essential for keeping the Hyperbridge chain live and processing transactions.
They are rewarded with `$BRIDGE`. The primary responsibility for Collators on Hyperbridge are:

- **Collecting Transactions**: They gather transactions from users.
- **Producing Blocks**: They ensure the production of Blocks.
- **Submitting to Polkadot Validators**: They submit Blocks  along with proof to the relay chain validators, in this case, Polkadot.

## The Relayer-Collator Relationship

In the Hyperbridge ecosystem, the path to becoming a collator begins with being a successful relayer. The two roles are intrinsically linked:

- **Relayers are the proving ground**: By relaying messages, you demonstrate your technical competence and commitment to the network's operation.
- **Next step is becoming a Collator**: The collator set is exclusively selected from the pool of active relayers. Your economic activity as a relayer is
the only way to gain the reputation required to be considered for a collator position.

This creates a meritocratic system where the most dedicated and effective network participants are promoted to roles with greater responsibility and rewards.

## Core Concepts: How Reputation Works

Before diving deep into the steps required, it is important to understand the two tokens involved:

- **The Hyperbridge Token(`$BRIDGE`)**: This is the primary token a Relayer earns as a reward for relaying messages. It is the real transferable asset that reflects or represents your earnings.
- **The Reputation Asset**: This is a special, non-transferable asset that acts as a Relayer's reputation score. It is designed to mirrror a Relayer's Hyperbridge token earnings.
The ratio of this asset to a Relayer's `$BRIDGE` earnings is 1 to 1. For every `$BRIDGE` token earned by a Relayer, an equal amount of the Reputation Asset is automatically minted to the Relayer's account.

**Key Insight**: Your reputation score is directly tied to your success as a Relayer. The more messages you relay, the more `$BRIDGE` you earn,
the higher your reputation score becomes, and the better your chances of being selected as a Collator

## The path to becoming a Collator
The process involves three main stages: Accruing reputation score/asset, preparing your node, and registering one's candidacy.

### Step 1: Accrue Reputation by Relaying Messages
This is the foundation of the entire system. The primary goal is to be an active and reliable relayer.

**Why Relayers**: Hyperbridge's Collator selection mechanism is based on proven economic activity on Hyperbridge. By rewarding relayers with reputation, we ensure that our collators are experienced,
active, and invested participants in the network success. This meritocratic system ensures liveness guarantees are upheld by selecting for proven value creation.

**Action**: Continue to relay messages or/and consensus proofs between connected chains

**Outcome**: For every reward you receive in `$BRIDGE`, the `pallet-messaging-relayer-fees` and `pallet-consensus-incentives` will automatically mint an equivalent amount of the Reputation Asset
to your account. You can always find your Reputation Asset balance under the Polkadot JS UI by going to `Developer > Chain State > Assets > Account`.

### Step 2: Prepare Your Collator Node and Session Keys
To be a collator, you must run a full node and have set of hot keys known as session keys, available in your node's keystore. These keys are used for signing blocks.

#### A Note on Key Types

You will be working with two types of keys:

- **Controller Account Key (sr25519)**: This is your main account key known as the controller account. It holds your reputation and is used to sign transactions. This key is what you used as the `signer` field in the `[hyperbridge]`
section of the messaging and consensus relayer config.
- **Session Key (aura)**: This is a "hot" key that lives on your collator node and is used for the high-frequency task of signing blocks.

**Generating a secure Account Key(If you don't have one)**: Your relayer's `signing` key will become your main collator account.
You can generate a new, secure `sr25519` key for this purpose using the `subkey` tool.

1. **Install Subkey**: if you don't have it, install it with the following command:

```
cargo install subkey
```

2. **Generate a Key**: Run the following command to generate a new key:

```
subkey generate --scheme sr25519
```

  <img src="/sample_subscan_generated.png" alt="Sample Key Generation with subscan  " />
  <figcaption style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>How to generate controller account key</figcaption>
</figure>


3.**Securely Store Your Keys**: The command will output a mnemonic phrase, a private key, and a public address. Securely backup your mnemonic phrase.
This is the master key to your account. The hexadecimal private key is what you will use as the signer in the `[hyperbridge]` section of both the messaging and consensus relayer configurations.

You can see a sample consensus relayer config showing the signing key which is the controller account as the key we generated using subkey:
```toml
# Hyperbridge consensus client config, required.
[hyperbridge]
# Specifies the consensus mechanism of the Hyperbridge chain.
# "grandpa" is used for Substrate-based chains utilizing the GRANDPA finality gadget.
# "beefy" is used for chains utilizing the BEEFY finality gadget
type = "grandpa"

# Configuration specific to the GRANDPA consensus client.
[hyperbridge.grandpa]
# The WebSocket RPC endpoint for a Standalone or Relay Chain.
rpc = "wss://localhost:443"
# The expected time duration for a block slot in milliseconds.
slot_duration = 6000
# A list of parachain IDs that are connected to this relay chain and should be monitored.
para_ids = [4009]

# Configuration for the Hyperbridge parachain itself.
[hyperbridge.substrate]
# The WebSocket RPC endpoint for the Hyperbridge parachain.
rpc_ws = "wss://localhost:443"
# The state machine identifier for the Hyperbridge parachain.
state_machine = "KUSAMA-4009"
# Relayer account seed.
signer = "0xe12f8d9bf570f710db4197853a306a20259b82b5a394fa06c64e8fa3037bcaa6"
...
```

You can see a sample messaging relayer config showing the signing key which is the controller account as the key we generated using subkey:
```toml
# Hyperbridge messaging config, required
[hyperbridge]
state_machine = "KUSAMA-4009"

# Hyperbridge node ws rpc endpoint.
rpc_ws = "ws://127.0.0.1:9944" # example endpoint

signer = "0xe12f8d9bf570f710db4197853a306a20259b82b5a394fa06c64e8fa3037bcaa6"

# Hyperbridge's consensus state id
# Only add this if relaying to a solochain.
# Relaying between solochains and parachains with the
# same relayer instance is not supported.
# For Paseo Testnet: PAS0
# For Polkadot Mainnet: DOT0
# consensus_state_id = "PAS0"

[bsc]
type = "evm"
poll_interval = 60
state_machine = "EVM-97"
rpc_urls = [
	"https://bsc-rpc.network",
]
consensus_state_id = "BSC0"
etherscan_api_key = ""
ismp_host = "0x8Aa0Dea6D675d785A882967Bf38183f6117C09b7"
signer = ""
tracing_batch_size = 5
query_batch_size = 10000

# Relayer config, required
[relayer]
# Define your profitability configuration.
# 0 -> 0% i.e relay all requests, even unprofitable ones.
# 1 -> 1%. ie fees provided for requests must be
# profitable by at least 1%. etc.
minimum_profit_percentage = 1

# How frequently to initiate withdrawals in seconds
# defaults to 24 hours
withdrawal_frequency = 86400

# Minimum amount to withdraw when auto-withdrawing
# defaults to $100
minimum_withdrawal_amount = 100

# If not empty, tesseract will only deliver requests
# to the specified state-machines
delivery_endpoints = [
    "EVM-97",
]

```


**Action 1: Set up a Collator Node**: You must have a fully synced node running the hyperbridge binary with --collator flag.
Ensure it is stable and has a reliable network connection.

**Action 2: Generate session Keys**: On your running collator node, you will need to generate your session keys by making an `author_rotateKeys` RPC Call.
You can do this with a curl command:


```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "author_rotateKeys", "params":[]}' http://localhost:9990
```

<figure>
  <img src="/rotate_keys.png" alt="Author rotate keys" />
  <figcaption style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>Result showing when you rotate keys</figcaption>
</figure>


Note: Replace 9990 with your node's RPC port if it is different.
This command will return a long hex string. This is your session key public key

**Action 3: Link your keys**: You must now tell the blockchain that your Controller account (`AccountId`) will use these new session keys for collating.
You do this by calling the `session.setKeys` extrinsic from your Controller account.

- Navigate to `Developer -> Extrinsics` in the Polkadot UI.
- Select your Controller account(the one with the reputation score).
    Note that this is your relayer's public key. It must be the same account that is configured as the `signer` in your relayer setup and is the account that has been accruing reputation.
- Choose the `session` pallet and the `setKeys` extrinsic.
- Paste the entire hex string from the previous step into the `keys` field.
- Leave the `proof` field empty (0x0).
- Sign and submit the transaction.

**Final Action: Prepare Your Node for Block Production**:
After you have successfully registered as a candidate, you should restart your node with the `--collator` flag. This prepares your
node to start producing blocks as soon as you are selected for the active set.

  <figcaption style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>How to set Session Keys</figcaption>
</figure>


### Step 3: Register as a Candidate
Now that the node is ready and your keys are linked, you can now declare your intention to becoming a Collator.

**Candidacy Bond**: To register as a candidate, your controller account must have a `$BRIDGE` token of at least the minimum candidacy bond, which is 1,000,000 $BRIDGE.
**Action**: Call the `collatorSelection.registerAsCandidate` extrinsic.

- Navigate to `Developer -> Extrinsics` in the Polkadot-JS UI.
- Select your Controller account.
     Note that this is your relayer's public key. It must be the same account that is configured as the `signer` in your relayer setup and is the account that has been accruing reputation.
- Choose the `collatorSelection` pallet and the `registerAsCandidate` extrinsic.
- Sign and submit the transaction.

<figure>
  <img src="/register_as_candidate.png" alt="Registering as candidate" />
  <figcaption style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>How to register as candidate</figcaption>
</figure>


This transaction will enable you to enter the candidacy pool.

## The selection process & what happens next

At the beginning of each new session, our `pallet-collator-manager` runs it's selection logic:

- It fetches the list of all registered candidates who have set their sesssion keys.
- It ranks them from highest to lowest based on their Reputation Asset balance.
- It selects the top candidates to fill the available collator slots for the new session.

If you are selected:

- Your Reputation Asset balance will be burned. This is somewhat like your stake for the session.
- Your node will begin authoring and producing blocks after 2 rounds(sessions). To do this, you must ensure that your node is running(or it has been restarted) with the `--collator` flag
- Bear in mind that as you are still performing your duties of relaying messages or consensus proofs, you will keep stacking `$BRIDGE` rewards
and your reputation asset will start increasing too, allowing you to compete for a spot in future sessions.

If you are not selected:

- You remain in the candidate pool.
- Continue relaying messages to increase you Reputation Asset balance and improve your chances of being selected in the next session.

This creates a dynamic and meritocratic system where the most active and successful participants are rewarded with the responsibility of securing the network.
