# Running a relayer

Critical to the function of Hyperbridge are relayers who transmit requests & responses across it's connected chains. These relayers much like node operators earn rewards for relaying requests. Since requests are paid for ahead of time on the source chain by the initiating application. Relayers can relay these requests and redeem their fees on the source chain. This works by the relayer showing state proofs to the hyperbridge parachain of their successful delivery. Hyperbridge then authorizes the release of the fees to the relayer on the source chain.


## Installation
