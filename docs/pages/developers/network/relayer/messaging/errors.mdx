# Common Relayer Errors

List of commonly seen errors with their explanation and tips on how to fix them.


## Insufficient funds for gas

```bash
ERROR tesseract_messaging: Failed to submit transaction to Evm(42161): Middleware error: (code: -32000, message: insufficient funds for gas * price + value: address <your-relayer-address> have 0 want 323200000000000, data: None
```

This error means your relayer account balance on the destination chain is insufficient to submit a transaction <br/>

:::success[How to Fix]
Fund your relayer account with the native gas token
:::

## Debug trace frame not found!

```bash
ERROR tesseract_evm::provider: Debug trace frame not found!
```
This error signifies that the `debug_TraceCall` call for a message failed, this could be that the message execution failed or the rpc does not provide debug trace logs<br/>
:::success[How to Fix]
Check with your rpc and ensure they provide debug trace logs for the `debug_TraceCall` RPC, in the case where message 
execution fails, the error can be safely ignored
:::


## Please ensure the contract and method you're calling exist

```bash
ERROR tesseract_messaging: Error while handling POLKADOT-3367 on Evm(8453): Invalid name: please ensure the contract and method you're calling exist! failed to decode empty bytes. if you're using jsonrpc this is likely due to jsonrpc returning `0x` in case contract or method don't exist
```

This error signifies misconfiured rpc endpoints or `ismp_host` addresses.<br/>
:::success[How to Fix]
Check your config file to ensure all `ismp_host` addresses and rpc endpoints are correctly configured
:::

## Error encountered while querying state_machine_update_time

```bash
ERROR tesseract: Messaging task Evm(56)->Polkadot(3367) encountered an error: StreamError("Error encountered while querying state_machine_update_time Middleware error: (code: -32000, message: header not found, data: None)")
```

This error means the rpc endpoint failed to return a valid response for a block header query<br/>
:::success[How to Fix]
Check that your rpc node is an archive node and full synced
:::

## Failed to submit unsigned extrinsic

```bash
ERROR tesseract_messaging: Failed to submit transaction to Polkadot(3367): Failed to submit unsigned extrinsic
```

This error means the relayer is trying to submit a duplicate transaction to hyperbridge<br/>
:::success[How to Fix]
You can safely ignore
:::

## The method debug_traceCall does not exist

```bash
ERROR tesseract_messaging: Error while handling POLKADOT-3367 on Evm(56): Middleware error: (code: -32601, message: The method debug_traceCall does not exist/is not available, data: None)
```

This error means your rpc endpoint does not provide the `debug_traceCall` method<br/>
:::success[How to Fix]
If running a private rpc node ensure the  `debug` namespace is enabled, otherwise contact your rpc provider
:::

## Error waiting for challenge period

```bash
ERROR tesseract: Error waiting for challenge period in Evm(56) - Polkadot(3367) update stream
```

This is usually caused by a network issue or invalid response from the rpc node<br/>
:::success[How to Fix]
The relayer automatically recovers from this, to reduce the frequency of this error ensure your network is stable and your 
rpc nodes are highly available
:::

## Failed to submit transaction to Evm(10): Transaction reverted

```bash
ERROR tesseract_messaging: Failed to submit transaction to Evm(10): Transaction reverted
```

This error means the relayer is tried to submit a duplicate transaction<br/>
:::success[How to Fix]
You can safely ignore
:::

## API key is not allowed to access method

```bash
ERROR tesseract_messaging: Error while handling POLKADOT-3367 on Evm(100): Middleware error: (code: -32053, message: API key is not allowed to access method, data: None)
```

This means the your rpc provider limits access to some endpoints<br/>
:::success[How to Fix]
Upgrade your rpc to a premium plan
:::

## Error fetching latest block height

```bash
ERROR tesseract: Messaging task Evm(56)->Polkadot(3367) encountered an error: StreamError("Error fetching latest block height on Evm(56) JsonRpcClientError(MiddlewareError(Middleware((code: -32603, message: request failed or timed out, data: None))))")
```

This is usually caused by a network issue or invalid response from the rpc node<br/>
:::success[How to Fix]
The relayer automatically recovers from this, to reduce the frequency of this error ensure your network is stable and your 
rpc nodes are highly available
:::

## Request failed or timed out

```bash
ERROR tesseract_evm::provider: Error while querying events in range 43812202..43812204 from Evm(56): Middleware error: (code: -32603, message: request failed or timed out, data: None)
```

This is usually caused by a network issue or invalid response from the rpc node<br/>
:::success[How to Fix]
The relayer automatically recovers from this, to reduce the frequency of this error ensure your network is stable and your 
rpc nodes are highly available
:::

## Internal server error
```bash
ERROR tesseract_evm::provider: Error while querying events in range 43816145..43816147 from Evm(56): Middleware error: (code: -32603, message: internal server error, data: None)
```

This is usually caused by a network issue or invalid response from the rpc node<br/>

:::success[How to Fix]
The relayer automatically recovers from this, to reduce the frequency of this error ensure your network is stable and your 
rpc nodes are highly available
:::


## Error accummulating some fees

```bash
ERROR tesseract_messaging: Error accummulating some fees, receipts have been stored in the db, you can try again manually
```

This error means the relayer encountered some error while accumulating fees on hyperbridge<br/>
:::success[How to Fix]
Try using the fee accumulation CLI to complete the process
:::


## Missing trie node

```bash
ERROR tesseract_messaging: Error while handling EVM-56 on Polkadot(3367): Middleware error: (code: -32000, message: missing trie node baf71a6410ba54b32b02056415efe6b22060c20aff9c399d9b6308d0a88c3d09 (path ) state 0xbaf71a6410ba54b32b02056415efe6b22060c20aff9c399d9b6308d0a88c3d09 is not available, data: None)
```

This error signifies that your rpc node is not archive<br/>
:::success[How to Fix]
Upgrade your rpc node to an archive node
:::

## Disconnected from telemetry

```bash
ERROR tesseract::cli: Disconnected from telemetry with: Text(
```

This error can be safely ignored as telemetry is not a critical function of the relayer
