# Message Delivery in Ismp
Messages in Ismp are delivered exclusively through the Handler contract. This contract acts as a gatekeeper, verifying all message proofs before delegating them to the EvmHost for dispatch to the intended module within the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) environment.

`Permissionless Delivery`: Anyone can submit messages for delivery as long as they possess valid proofs from Hyperbridge and cover the necessary transaction fees. This permissionless approach fosters an open and accessible system.

## Events 

Upon successful execution of ISMP messages, specific events are generated and recorded in the runtime. These events serve as confirmation for the successful processing of different message types.  

    * `PostRequestHandled`
    * `PostResponseHandled`
    * `PostRequestTimeoutHandled`
    * `PostResponseTimeoutHandled`
    * `GetResponseHandled`

## Message Types
Ismp supports different message types with dedicated delivery methods:

* `Consensus Messages`: These messages are delivered through the handleConsensus transaction. They likely play a crucial role in maintaining network consensus.  
* `Request-Response Messages`:
    * `Post Requests`: Delivered by calling handlePostRequests on the EvmHandler contract.
    * `Post Responses`: Delivered by calling handlePostResponses on the Handler contract.
    * `Get Responses`: Delivered by calling handleGetResponses.
* `Timeout Messages`: If a request or response exceeds a predefined wait time, a timeout message can be submitted. Specific functions handle these timeouts:
    `handlePostRequestTimeouts`
    `handlePostResponseTimeouts`
    `handleGetRequestTimeouts`
